# MISP_CTI_dataset

WARNING: This dataset may have some wrong tag, it up to your definition of entities in cyber-security. You can also use untagged data to create your dataset. 

This is a BIO tagging format for Malware Information Sharing Platform CTI NER trainning. 
I tried to expand recoginition range to Non-named entity to make the NER model more practical. 
Entity types in this dataset include Malware, TTPs(Tactic, Technique, Procedure), Application, Threat Actor, Reporter(of this CTI), Protocol, Indicator, Vulnerability.

If you have any question for this project, you can post an issue. I will try my best to help you.

Thank you!!
