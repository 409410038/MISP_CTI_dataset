# MISP_CTI_dataset

WARNING: This dataset may have some wrong tags, it is up to your definition of entities in cyber-security. You can also use untagged data to create your dataset. 

This is a BIO tagging format for Malware Information Sharing Platform CTI NER training. 
I tried to expand the recognition range to Non-named entities to make the NER model more practical. 
Entity types in this dataset include Malware, TTPs(Tactic, Technique, Procedure), Application, Threat Actor, Reporter(of this CTI), Protocol, Indicator, and Vulnerability.

This is just a project from my Bachelor's degree. I won't be updating the dataset anymore. If you have any questions about this project, you can raise an issue. I will try my best to help you.

The NER model training tool I use: https://github.com/aiforsec/CyNER

Thank you!!

p.s. My Python tools code is not sorted out. I suggest you use your own code to generate dataset or preprocess data:)
