# MISP_CTI_dataset

WARNING: This dataset may have some wrong tag, it up to your definition of entities in cyber-security. You can also use untagged data to create your dataset. 

This is a BIO tagging format for Malware Information Sharing Platform CTI NER trainning. 
I tried to expand recoginition range to Non-named entity to make the NER model more practical. 
Entity types in this dataset include Malware, TTPs(Tactic, Technique, Procedure), Application, Threat Actor, Reporter(of this CTI), Protocol, Indicator, Vulnerability.

This is just a project from my Bachelor's degree. I won't be updating the dataset anymore. If you have any questions for this project, you can raise an issue. I will try my best to help you.

Thank you!!
