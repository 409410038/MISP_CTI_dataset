The
Menlo
Labs
Team
noticed
some
very
interesting
and
seemingly
overlapping
IcedID
campaigns
over
the
past
couple
of
months
.
IcedID
is
a
modular
trojan
that
made
its
appearance
in
2017
,
and
since
then
it
’
s
proven
itself
to
be
one
the
most
notorious
pieces
of
malware
.
In
this
blog
we
will
briefly
touch
on
the
different
IcedID
campaigns
we
have
been
tracking
including
:
Malicious
