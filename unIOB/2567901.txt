XSS
Using
MIME
Type
Mismatch
An
adversary
creates
a
file
with
scripting
content
but
where
the
specified
MIME
type
of
the
file
is
such
that
scripting
is
not
expected
.
The
adversary
tricks
the
victim
into
accessing
a
URL
that
responds
with
the
script
file
.
Some
browsers
will
detect
that
the
specified
MIME
type
of
the
file
does
not
match
the
actual
type
of
its
content
and
will
automatically
switch
to
using
an
interpreter
for
the
real
content
type
.
If
the
browser
does
not
invoke
script
filters
before
doing
this
,
the
adversary
's
script
may
run
on
the
target
unsanitized
,
possibly
revealing
the
victim
's
cookies
or
executing
arbitrary
script
in
their
browser
.
The
victim
must
follow
a
crafted
link
that
references
a
scripting
file
that
is
mis-typed
as
a
non-executable
file
.
The
victim's
browser
must
detect
the
true
type
of
a
mis-labeled
scripting
file
and
invoke
the
appropriate
script
interpreter
without
first
performing
filtering
on
the
content
.
