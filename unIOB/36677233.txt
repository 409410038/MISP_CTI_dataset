These
IOCs
come
from
an
FBI
alert
analyzing
the
LockBit
ransomware
.
Most
of
the
IOCs
provided
are
already
known
though
.
The
FBI
considers
this
ransomware
dangerous
because
of
its
obfuscation
and
evasion
mechanisms
,
as
well
as
certain
features
that
allow
it
to
encrypt
an
entire
Active
Directory
domain
through
Windows
GPOs
.
The
present
event
,
compiled
by
CUDESO
,
has
the
advantage
of
giving
the
complete
list
of
commands
executed
during
a
typical
LockBit
infection
,
information
that
was
not
present
in
the
previous
event
