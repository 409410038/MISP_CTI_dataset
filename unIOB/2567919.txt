Server
Side
Include
(
SSI
)
Injection
An
attacker
can
use
Server
Side
Include
(
SSI
)
Injection
to
send
code
to
a
web
application
that
then
gets
executed
by
the
web
server
.
Doing
so
enables
the
attacker
to
achieve
similar
results
to
Cross
Site
Scripting
,
viz.
,
arbitrary
code
execution
and
information
disclosure
,
albeit
on
a
more
limited
scale
,
since
the
SSI
directives
are
nowhere
near
as
powerful
as
a
full-fledged
scripting
language
.
Nonetheless
,
the
attacker
can
conveniently
gain
access
to
sensitive
files
,
such
as
password
files
,
and
execute
shell
commands
.
A
web
server
that
supports
server
side
includes
and
has
them
enabled
User
controllable
input
that
can
carry
include
directives
to
the
web
server
Set
the
OPTIONS
IncludesNOEXEC
in
the
global
access.conf
file
or
local
.htaccess
(
Apache
)
file
to
deny
SSI
execution
in
directories
that
do
not
need
them
All
user
controllable
input
must
be
appropriately
sanitized
before
use
in
the
application
.
This
includes
omitting
,
or
encoding
,
certain
characters
or
strings
that
have
the
potential
of
being
interpreted
as
part
of
an
SSI
directive
Server
Side
Includes
must
be
enabled
only
if
there
is
a
strong
business
reason
to
do
so
.
Every
additional
component
enabled
on
the
web
server
increases
the
attack
surface
as
well
as
administrative
overhead
