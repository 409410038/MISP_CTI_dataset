Server
Side
Include
(
SSI
)
Injection
.
An
attacker
can
use
Server
Side
Include
(
SSI
)
Injection
to
send
code
to
a
web
application
that
then
gets
executed
by
the
web
server
.
Doing
so
enables
the
attacker
to
achieve
similar
results
to
Cross
Site
Scripting
,
viz.
,
arbitrary
code
execution
and
information
disclosure
,
albeit
on
a
more
limited
scale
,
since
the
SSI
directives
are
nowhere
near
as
powerful
as
a
full-fledged
scripting
language
.
Nonetheless
,
the
attacker
can
conveniently
gain
access
to
sensitive
files
,
such
as
password
files
,
and
execute
shell
commands
.
A
web
server
that
supports
server
side
includes
and
has
them
enabled
User
controllable
input
that
can
carry
include
directives
to
the
web
server
.
Set
the
OPTIONS
IncludesNOEXEC
in
the
global
access.conf
file
or
local
.htaccess
(
Apache
)
file
to
deny
SSI
execution
in
directories
that
do
not
need
them
All
user
controllable
input
must
be
appropriately
sanitized
before
use
in
the
application
.
This
includes
omitting
,
or
encoding
,
certain
characters
or
strings
that
have
the
potential
of
being
interpreted
as
part
of
an
SSI
directive
Server
Side
Includes
must
be
enabled
only
if
there
is
a
strong
business
reason
to
do
so
.
Every
additional
component
enabled
on
the
web
server
increases
the
attack
surface
as
well
as
administrative
overhead
