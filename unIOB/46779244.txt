A
flaw
was
found
in
the
Linux
kernel
,
where
unauthorized
access
to
the
execution
of
the
setuid
file
with
capabilities
was
found
in
the
Linux
kernel
&
#
8217
;
s
OverlayFS
subsystem
in
how
a
user
copies
a
capable
file
from
a
nosuid
mount
into
another
mount
.
This
uid
mapping
bug
allows
a
local
user
to
escalate
their
privileges
on
the
system
.
