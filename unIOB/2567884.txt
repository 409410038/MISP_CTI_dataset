An
attacker
gains
access
to
application
,
service
,
or
device
with
the
privileges
of
an
authorized
or
privileged
user
by
evading
or
circumventing
an
authentication
mechanism
.
The
attacker
is
therefore
able
to
access
protected
data
without
authentication
ever
having
taken
place
.
This
refers
to
an
attacker
gaining
access
equivalent
to
an
authenticated
user
without
ever
going
through
an
authentication
procedure
.
This
is
usually
the
result
of
the
attacker
using
an
unexpected
access
procedure
that
does
not
go
through
the
proper
checkpoints
where
authentication
should
occur
.
For
example
,
a
web
site
might
assume
that
all
users
will
click
through
a
given
link
in
order
to
get
to
secure
material
and
simply
authenticate
everyone
that
clicks
the
link
.
However
,
an
attacker
might
be
able
to
reach
secured
web
content
by
explicitly
entering
the
path
to
the
content
rather
than
clicking
through
the
authentication
link
,
thereby
avoiding
the
check
entirely
.
This
attack
pattern
differs
from
other
authentication
attacks
in
that
attacks
of
this
pattern
avoid
authentication
entirely
,
rather
than
faking
authentication
by
exploiting
flaws
or
by
stealing
credentials
from
legitimate
users
.
An
authentication
mechanism
or
subsystem
implementing
some
form
of
authentication
such
as
passwords
,
digest
authentication
,
security
certificates
,
etc
.
