Qakbot
(
aka
Pinkslipbot
,
Qbot
)
has
persisted
as
a
banking
trojan
–
then
a
potent
malware/ransomware
distribution
network
–
for
well
over
a
decade
,
its
origins
going
back
as
far
as
2007
.
As
a
ransomware
botnet
,
Qakbot
is
usually
spread
through
email
hijacking
and
social
engineering
,
dropping
malicious
files
that
infect
Windows
hosts
.
This
botnet
has
adapted
techniques
to
conceal
its
infrastructure
in
residential
IP
space
and
infected
web
servers
,
as
opposed
to
hiding
in
a
network
of
hosted
virtual
private
servers
(
VPSs
)
.
Qakbot
alternates
its
means
of
initial
entry
to
stay
ahead
of
tightening
security
policies
and
evolving
defenses
.

and

threat
