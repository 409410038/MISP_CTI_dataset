Grafana
is
an
open-source
platform
for
monitoring
and
observability
.
When
datasource
query
caching
is
enabled
,
Grafana
caches
all
headers
,
including
`
grafana_session
`
.
As
a
result
,
any
user
that
queries
a
datasource
where
the
caching
is
enabled
can
acquire
another
user
&
#

;
s
session
.
To
mitigate
the
vulnerability
you
can
disable
datasource
query
caching
for
all
datasources
.
This
issue
has
been
patched
in
versions
9.2.10
and
9.3.4
.
