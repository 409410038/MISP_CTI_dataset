Using
Malicious
Files
.
An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
a
system
's
configuration
that
allows
an
attacker
to
either
directly
access
an
executable
file
,
for
example
through
shell
access
;
or
in
a
possible
worst
case
allows
an
attacker
to
upload
a
file
and
then
execute
it
.
Web
servers
,
ftp
servers
,
and
message
oriented
middleware
systems
which
have
many
integration
points
are
particularly
vulnerable
,
because
both
the
programmers
and
the
administrators
must
be
in
synch
regarding
the
interfaces
and
the
correct
privileges
for
each
interface
.
System's
configuration
must
allow
an
attacker
to
directly
access
executable
files
or
upload
files
to
execute
.
This
means
that
any
access
control
system
that
is
supposed
to
mediate
communications
between
the
subject
and
the
object
is
set
incorrectly
or
assumes
a
benign
environment
.
Design
:
Enforce
principle
of
least
privilege
Design
:
Run
server
interfaces
with
a
non-root
account
and/or
utilize
chroot
jails
or
other
configuration
techniques
to
constrain
privileges
even
if
attacker
gains
some
limited
access
to
commands
.
Implementation
:
Perform
testing
such
as
pen-testing
and
vulnerability
scanning
to
identify
directories
,
programs
,
and
interfaces
that
grant
direct
access
to
executables
.
