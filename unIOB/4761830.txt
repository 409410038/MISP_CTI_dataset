We
introduced
Tomiris
to
the
world
in
September
2021
,
following
our
investigation
of
a
DNS-hijack
against
a
government
organization
in
the
Commonwealth
of
Independent
States
(
CIS
)
.
Our
initial
report
described
links
between
a
Tomiris
Golang
implant
and
SUNSHUTTLE
(
which
has
been
associated
to
NOBELIUM/APT29/TheDukes
)
as
well
as
Kazuar
(
which
has
been
associated
to
Turla
)
;
however
,
interpreting
these
connections
proved
difficult
.
We
continued
to
track
Tomiris
as
a
separate
threat
actor
over
three
new
attack
campaigns
between
2021
and
2023
,
and
our
telemetry
allowed
us
to
shed
light
on
the
group
.
In
this
blog
post
,
we
â€™
re
excited
to
share
what
we
now
know
of
Tomiris
with
the
broader
community
,
and
discuss
further
evidence
of
a
possible
connection
to
Turla
.
