The
malicious
URLs
provided
in
the
emails
also
appear
to
use
values
that
are
customized
for
each
target
,
although
they
all
redirect
to
the
same
page
and
serve
the
same
malicious
payload
.
In
one
instance
the
threat
actor
was
observed
appending
the
URI
extension
“
?
p=23-
<
#
#
>
”
.
It
appears
that
p=23
specifies
the
page
value
for
landing
page
the
user
is
redirected
to
,
while
the
number
string
that
follows
it
,
e.g
.
the
“
11
”
in
“
?
p=23-11
”
,
appears
to
be
a
unique
identifier
for
each
recipient
.
