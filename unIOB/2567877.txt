Man
in
the
Middle
Attack
This
type
of
attack
targets
the
communication
between
two
components
(
typically
client
and
server
)
.
The
attacker
places
himself
in
the
communication
channel
between
the
two
components
.
Whenever
one
component
attempts
to
communicate
with
the
other
(
data
flow
,
authentication
challenges
,
etc
.
)
,
the
data
first
goes
to
the
attacker
,
who
has
the
opportunity
to
observe
or
alter
it
,
and
it
is
then
passed
on
to
the
other
component
as
if
it
was
never
observed
.
This
interposition
is
transparent
leaving
the
two
compromised
components
unaware
of
the
potential
corruption
or
leakage
of
their
communications
.
The
potential
for
Man-in-the-Middle
attacks
yields
an
implicit
lack
of
trust
in
communication
or
identify
between
two
components
.
MITM
attacks
differ
from
sniffing
attacks
since
they
often
modify
the
communications
prior
to
delivering
it
to
the
intended
recipient
.
These
attacks
also
differ
from
interception
attacks
since
they
may
forward
the
sender
's
original
unmodified
data
,
after
copying
it
,
instead
of
keeping
it
for
themselves
.
There
are
two
components
communicating
with
each
other
.
An
attacker
is
able
to
identify
the
nature
and
mechanism
of
communication
between
the
two
target
components
.
An
attacker
can
eavesdrop
on
the
communication
between
the
target
components
.
Strong
mutual
authentication
is
not
used
between
the
two
target
components
yielding
opportunity
for
attacker
interposition
.
The
communication
occurs
in
clear
(
not
encrypted
)
or
with
insufficient
and
spoofable
encryption
.

Encrypt
your
communication
using

(

Use
Strong
mutual
authentication
to

both
ends
of
any
