Buffer
Overflow
via
Parameter
Expansion
In
this
attack
,
the
target
software
is
given
input
that
the
attacker
knows
will
be
modified
and
expanded
in
size
during
processing
.
This
attack
relies
on
the
target
software
failing
to
anticipate
that
the
expanded
data
may
exceed
some
internal
limit
,
thereby
creating
a
buffer
overflow
.
The
program
expands
one
of
the
parameters
passed
to
a
function
with
input
controlled
by
the
user
,
but
a
later
function
making
use
of
the
expanded
parameter
erroneously
considers
the
original
,
not
the
expanded
size
of
the
parameter
.
The
expanded
parameter
is
used
in
the
context
where
buffer
overflow
may
become
possible
due
to
the
incorrect
understanding
of
the
parameter
size
(
i.e
.
thinking
that
it
is
smaller
than
it
really
is
)
.
Ensure
that
when
parameter
expansion
happens
in
the
code
that
the
assumptions
used
to
determine
the
resulting
size
of
the
parameter
are
accurate
and
that
the
new
size
of
the
parameter
is
visible
to
the
whole
system
