Reusing
Session
IDs
(
aka
Session
Replay
)
.
This
attack
targets
the
reuse
of
valid
session
ID
to
spoof
the
target
system
in
order
to
gain
privileges
.
The
attacker
tries
to
reuse
a
stolen
session
ID
used
previously
during
a
transaction
to
perform
spoofing
and
session
hijacking
.
Another
name
for
this
type
of
attack
is
Session
Replay
.
The
target
host
uses
session
IDs
to
keep
track
of
the
users
.
Session
IDs
are
used
to
control
access
to
resources
.
The
session
IDs
used
by
the
target
host
are
not
well
protected
from
session
theft
.
Always
invalidate
a
session
ID
after
the
user
logout
.
Setup
a
session
time
out
for
the
session
IDs
.
Protect
the
communication
between
the
client
and
server
.
For
instance
it
is
best
practice
to
use
SSL
to
mitigate
man
in
the
middle
attack
.
Do
not
code
send
session
ID
with
GET
method
,
otherwise
the
session
ID
will
be
copied
to
the
URL
.
In
general
avoid
writing
session
IDs
in
the
URLs
.
URLs
can
get
logged
in
log
files
,
which
are
vulnerable
to
an
attacker
.
Encrypt
the
session
data
associated
with
the
session
ID
.
Use
multifactor
authentication
.
