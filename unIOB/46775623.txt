Interestingly
,
the
actors
made
no
significant
changes
in
the
core
of
their
modular
backdoor
in
the
seven
years
after
its
discovery
in
2014
by
Kaspersky
and
Symantec
.
As
described
in
the
aforementioned
reports
,
we
observed
multiple
samples
of
Cloud
Atlas
â€™
modular
backdoor
.
Each
is
an
obfuscated
DLL
accompanied
by
an
encrypted
file
,
with
both
DLL
and
data
files
named
using
random
words
.
For
example
,
a
DLL
named
beachmaster.dll
was
accompanied
by
an
encrypted
file
named
examinere
.
Each
DLL
has
multiple
randomly-named
export
functions
,
only
one
of
which
is
relevant
.
When
the
relevant
export
function
is
called
,
the
DLL
begins
to
decrypt
and
load
an
embedded
PE
file
.
The
loaded
PE
file
then
XOR-decrypts
a
hardcoded
struct
that
instructs
it
how
to
decrypt
the
companion
file
.
