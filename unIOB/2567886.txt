Upload
a
Web
Shell
to
a
Web
Server
.
By
exploiting
insufficient
permissions
,
it
is
possible
to
upload
a
web
shell
to
a
web
server
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
be
executed
remotely
.
This
shell
can
have
various
capabilities
,
thereby
acting
as
a
''
gateway
''
to
the
underlying
web
server
.
The
shell
might
execute
at
the
higher
permission
level
of
the
web
server
,
providing
the
ability
the
execute
malicious
code
at
elevated
levels
.
The
web
server
is
susceptible
to
one
of
the
various
web
application
exploits
that
allows
for
uploading
a
shell
file
.
Insure
that
the
file
permissions
in
directories
on
the
web
server
from
which
files
can
be
execute
is
set
to
the
''
least
privilege
''
settings
,
and
that
those
directories
contents
is
controlled
by
a
whitelist
.
