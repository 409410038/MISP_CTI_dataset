As
an
anti-analysis
measure
,
Crimson
RAT
variants
delay
their
execution
for
a
given
time
period
,
for
example
,
61
,
180
,
or
241
seconds
.
Most
of
the
Crimson
RAT
variants
we
analyzed
evaluate
whether
they
execute
at
a
machine
named
G551JW
or
DESKTOP-B83U7C5
and
establish
persistence
by
creating
a
registry
key
under
\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
only
if
the
victim
â€™
s
machine
name
differs
.
G551JW
or
DESKTOP-B83U7C5
may
be
the
names
of
the
machines
where
Crimson
RAT
developers
have
been
running
test
executions
.
