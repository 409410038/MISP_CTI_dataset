Tampering
Web
Logs
Tampering
attacks
involve
an
attacker
injecting
,
deleting
or
otherwise
tampering
with
the
contents
of
web
logs
typically
for
the
purposes
of
masking
other
malicious
behavior
.
Additionally
,
writing
malicious
data
to
log
files
may
target
jobs
,
filters
,
reports
,
and
other
agents
that
process
the
logs
in
an
asynchronous
attack
pattern
.
This
pattern
of
attack
is
similar
to
``
Log
Injection-Tampering-Forging
''
except
that
in
this
case
,
the
attack
is
targeting
the
logs
of
the
web
server
and
not
the
application
.
Target
server
software
must
be
a
HTTP
server
that
performs
web
logging
.
