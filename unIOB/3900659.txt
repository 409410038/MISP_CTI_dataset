We
recently
discovered
ransomware
,
which
performs
MSDTC
service
DLL
Hijacking
to
silently
execute
its
payload
.
We
have
named
this
ransomware
CatB
,
based
on
the
contact
email
that
the
ransomware
group
uses
.
The
sample
was
first
uploaded
to
VT
on
November
23
,
2022
and
tagged
by
the
VT
community
as
a
possible
variant
of
the
Pandora
Ransomware
.
The
assumed
connection
to
the
Pandora
Ransomware
was
due
to
some
similarities
between
the
CatB
and
Pandora
ransom
notes
.
However
,
the
similarities
pretty
much
end
there
.
The
CatB
ransomware
implements
several
anti-VM
techniques
to
verify
execution
on
a
“
real
machine
”
,
followed
by
a
malicious
DLL
drop
and
DLL
hijacking
to
evade
detection
.
CatB
ransomware
contains
two
files
,
the
dropper
(
version.dll
)
,
packed
with
UPX
,
and
the
ransomware
payload
(
oci.dll
)
.
The
dropper
handles
anti-VM
checks
,
dropping
the
ransomware
payload
and
executing
it
.
