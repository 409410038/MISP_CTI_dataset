Circa
the
beginning
of
August
2022
,
while
doing
security
monitoring
&
incident
response
services
,
GTSC
SOC
team
discovered
that
a
critical
infrastructure
was
being
attacked
,
specifically
to
their
Microsoft
Exchange
application
.
During
the
investigation
,
GTSC
Blue
Team
experts
determined
that
the
attack
utilized
an
unpublished
Exchange
security
vulnerability
,
i.e.
,
a
0-day
vulnerability
,
thus
immediately
came
up
with
a
temporary
containment
plan
.
At
the
same
time
,
Red
Team
experts
started
researching
and
debugging
Exchange
de-compiled
code
to
find
the
vulnerability
and
exploit
code
.
Thanks
to
experience
finding
the
previous
1-day
Exchange
exploit
,
the
RedTeam
has
a
great
understanding
of
Exchange
â€™
s
code
flows
and
processing
mechanisms
,
therefore
research
time
was
reduced
,
and
the
vulnerability
was
uncovered
quickly
.
The
vulnerability
turns
out
to
be
so
critical
that
it
allows
the
attacker
to
do
RCE
on
the
compromised
system
.
GTSC
submitted
the
vulnerability
to
the
Zero
Day
Initiative
(
ZDI
)
right
away
to
work
with
Microsoft
so
that
a
patch
could
be
prepared
as
soon
as
possible
.
ZDI
verified
and
acknowledged
2
bugs
,
whose
CVSS
scores
are
8.8
and
6.3
,
concerning
the
exploit
as
follows
.
However
up
to
now
,
GTSC
has
seen
other
customers
also
experiencing
the
similar
problem
.
After
careful
testing
,
we
confirmed
that
those
systems
were
being
attacked
using
this
0-day
vulnerability
.
To
help
the
community
temporarily
stop
the
attack
before
an
official
patch
from
Microsoft
is
available
,
we
publish
this
article
aiming
to
those
organizations
who
are
using
Microsoft
Exchange
email
system
.
