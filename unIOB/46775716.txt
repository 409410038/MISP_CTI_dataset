When
investigating
the
network
logs
on
the
patient
zero
server
to
identify
entities
connecting
to
the
webshells
,
WithSecureâ„¢
realized
that
one
of
the
connections
originated
from
a
North
Korean
IP
address
:
175.45.176
[
.
]
27
This
connection
was
a
single
instance
at
the
beginning
of
that
current
day
.
It
was
both
preceded
on
the
previous
days
,
as
well
as
followed
(
with
a
delay
)
by
connections
coming
from
a
proxy
address
:
209.95.60
[
.
]
92
.
We
suspect
that
this
instance
was
an
operational
security
failure
by
the
threat
actor
at
the
start
of
their
workday
and
after
a
small
delay
they
came
back
via
the
intended
route
.
This
is
significant
as
the
only
North
Korean
IP
address-
es
are
three
/24
networks
which
are
directly
controlled
and
used
by
the
North
Korean
government
,
and
as
such
it
is
extremely
likely
that
this
activity
was
initiated
by
a
North
Korean
state
actor
.
