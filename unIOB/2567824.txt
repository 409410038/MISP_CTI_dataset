Using
Slashes
in
Alternate
Encoding
.
This
attack
targets
the
encoding
of
the
Slash
characters
.
An
attacker
would
try
to
exploit
common
filtering
problems
related
to
the
use
of
the
slashes
characters
to
gain
access
to
resources
on
the
target
host
.
Directory-driven
systems
,
such
as
file
systems
and
databases
,
typically
use
the
slash
character
to
indicate
traversal
between
directories
or
other
container
components
.
For
murky
historical
reasons
,
PCs
(
and
,
as
a
result
,
Microsoft
OSs
)
choose
to
use
a
backslash
,
whereas
the
UNIX
world
typically
makes
use
of
the
forward
slash
.
The
schizophrenic
result
is
that
many
MS-based
systems
are
required
to
understand
both
forms
of
the
slash
.
This
gives
the
attacker
many
opportunities
to
discover
and
abuse
a
number
of
common
filtering
problems
.
The
goal
of
this
pattern
is
to
discover
server
software
that
only
applies
filters
to
one
version
,
but
not
the
other
.
The
application
server
accepts
paths
to
locate
resources
.
The
application
server
does
insufficient
input
data
validation
on
the
resource
path
requested
by
the
user
.
The
access
right
to
resources
are
not
set
properly
.
Any
security
checks
should
occur
after
the
data
has
been
decoded
and
validated
as
correct
data
format
.
Do
not
repeat
decoding
process
,
if
bad
character
are
left
after
decoding
process
,
treat
the
data
as
suspicious
,
and
fail
the
validation
process
.
Refer
to
the
RFCs
to
safely
decode
URL
.
When
client
input
is
required
from
web-based
forms
,
avoid
using
the
``
GET
''
method
to
submit
data
,
as
the
method
causes
the
form
data
to
be
appended
to
the
URL
and
is
easily
manipulated
.
Instead
,
use
the
``
POST
method
whenever
possible
.
There
are
tools
to
scan
HTTP
requests
to
the
server
for
valid
URL
such
as
URLScan
from
Microsoft
(

)
Be
aware
of
the
threat
of
alternative
method
of
data
encoding
and
obfuscation
technique
such
as
IP
address
encoding
.

See
related
guideline

Test
your
path
decoding
process
against
malicious
input
.
In
the
case
of
path
traversals
,
use
the
principle
of
least
privilege
when
determining
access
rights
to
file
systems
.
Do
not
allow
users
to
access
directories/files
that
they
should
not
access
.
Assume
all
input
is
malicious
.
Create
a
white
list
that
defines
all
valid
input
to
the
application
based
on
the
requirements
specifications
.
Input
that
does
not
match
against
the
white
list
should
not
be
permitted
to
enter
into
the
system
.
