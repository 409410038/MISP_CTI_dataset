In
some
cases
,
BlackCat
operators
use
the
chat
to
threaten
the
victim
,
claiming
they
will
perform
a
DDoS
attack
on
the
victims
'
infrastructure
if
the
ransom
is
not
paid
.
When
it
appears
in
addition
to
the
use
of
a
leak
site
,
this
practice
is
known
as
triple
extortion
,
a
tactic
that
was
observed
being
used
by
groups
like
Avaddon
and
Suncrypt
in
the
past
.
