In
February
2022
we
observed
the
technique
of
putting
the
shellcode
into
Windows
event
logs
for
the
first
time
“
in
the
wild
”
during
the
malicious
campaign
.
It
allows
the
“
fileless
”
last
stage
Trojan
to
be
hidden
from
plain
sight
in
the
file
system
.
Such
attention
to
the
event
logs
in
the
campaign
isn
’
t
limited
to
storing
shellcodes
.
Dropper
modules
also
patch
Windows
native
API
functions
,
related
to
event
tracing
(
ETW
)
and
anti-malware
scan
interface
(
AMSI
)
,
to
make
the
infection
process
stealthier
.
