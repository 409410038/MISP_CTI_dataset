A
double-free
flaw
was
found
in
the
Linux
kernel
&
#
8217
;
s
TUN/TAP
device
driver
functionality
in
how
a
user
registers
the
device
when
the
register_netdevice
function
fails
(
NETDEV_REGISTER
notifier
)
.
This
flaw
allows
a
local
user
to
crash
or
potentially
escalate
their
privileges
on
the
system
.
