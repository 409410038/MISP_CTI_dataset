Executive
Summary
:
On
May
24
,
2022
,
Cisco
became
aware
of
a
potential
compromise
.
Since
that
point
,
Cisco
Security
Incident
Response
(
CSIRT
)
and
Cisco
Talos
have
been
working
to
remediate
.
During
the
investigation
,
it
was
determined
that
a
Cisco
employee
’
s
credentials
were
compromised
after
an
attacker
gained
control
of
a
personal
Google
account
where
credentials
saved
in
the
victim
’
s
browser
were
being
synchronized
.
The
attacker
conducted
a
series
of
sophisticated
voice
phishing
attacks
under
the
guise
of
various
trusted
organizations
attempting
to
convince
the
victim
to
accept
multi-factor
authentication
(
MFA
)
push
notifications
initiated
by
the
attacker
.
The
attacker
ultimately
succeeded
in
achieving
an
MFA
push
acceptance
,
granting
them
access
to
VPN
in
the
context
of
the
targeted
user
.
CSIRT
and
Talos
are
responding
to
the
event
and
we
have
not
identified
any
evidence
suggesting
that
the
attacker
gained
access
to
critical
internal
systems
,
such
as
those
related
to
product
development
,
code
signing
,
etc
.
After
obtaining
initial
access
,
the
threat
actor
conducted
a
variety
of
activities
to
maintain
access
,
minimize
forensic
artifacts
,
and
increase
their
level
of
access
to
systems
within
the
environment
.
The
threat
actor
was
successfully
removed
from
the
environment
and
displayed
persistence
,
repeatedly
attempting
to
regain
access
in
the
weeks
following
the
attack
;
however
,
these
attempts
were
unsuccessful
.
We
assess
with
moderate
to
high
confidence
that
this
attack
was
conducted
by
an
adversary
that
has
been
previously
identified
as
an
initial
access
broker
(
IAB
)
with
ties
to
the
UNC2447
cybercrime
gang
,
Lapsus
$
threat
actor
group
,
and
Yanluowang
ransomware
operators
.
