The
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
(
FBI
)
,
the
Cybersecurity
and
Infrastructure
Security
Agency
(
CISA
)
,
and
the
Multi-State
Information
Sharing
and
Analysis
Center
(
MS-ISAC
)
are
releasing
this
joint
CSA
to
disseminate
IOCs
and
TTPs
associated
with
Vice
Society
actors
identified
through
FBI
investigations
as
recently
as
September
2022
.
The
FBI
,
CISA
,
and
the
MS-ISAC
have
recently
observed
Vice
Society
actors
disproportionately
targeting
the
education
sector
with
ransomware
attacks
.
Over
the
past
several
years
,
the
education
sector
,
especially
kindergarten
through
twelfth
grade
(
K-12
)
institutions
,
have
been
a
frequent
target
of
ransomware
attacks
.
Impacts
from
these
attacks
have
ranged
from
restricted
access
to
networks
and
data
,
delayed
exams
,
canceled
school
days
,
and
unauthorized
access
to
and
theft
of
personal
information
regarding
students
and
staff
.
The
FBI
,
CISA
,
and
the
MS-ISAC
anticipate
attacks
may
increase
as
the
2022/2023
school
year
begins
and
criminal
ransomware
groups
perceive
opportunities
for
successful
attacks
.
School
districts
with
limited
cybersecurity
capabilities
and
constrained
resources
are
often
the
most
vulnerable
;
however
,
the
opportunistic
targeting
often
seen
with
cyber
criminals
can
still
put
school
districts
with
robust
cybersecurity
programs
at
risk
.
K-12
institutions
may
be
seen
as
particularly
lucrative
targets
due
to
the
amount
of
sensitive
student
data
accessible
through
school
systems
or
their
managed
service
providers
.
The
FBI
,
CISA
,
and
the
MS-ISAC
encourage
organizations
to
implement
the
recommendations
in
the
Mitigations
section
of
this
CSA
to
reduce
the
likelihood
and
impact
of
ransomware
incidents
.
