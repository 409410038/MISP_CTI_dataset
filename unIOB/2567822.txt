Using
Escaped
Slashes
in
Alternate
Encoding
This
attack
targets
the
use
of
the
backslash
in
alternate
encoding
.
An
attacker
can
provide
a
backslash
as
a
leading
character
and
causes
a
parser
to
believe
that
the
next
character
is
special
.
This
is
called
an
escape
.
By
using
that
trick
,
the
attacker
tries
to
exploit
alternate
ways
to
encode
the
same
character
which
leads
to
filter
problems
and
opens
avenues
to
attack
.
The
application
accepts
the
backlash
character
as
escape
character
.
The
application
server
does
incomplete
input
data
decoding
,
filtering
and
validation
.
Verify
that
the
user-supplied
data
does
not
use
backslash
character
to
escape
malicious
characters
.
Assume
all
input
is
malicious
.
Create
a
white
list
that
defines
all
valid
input
to
the
software
system
based
on
the
requirements
specifications
.
Input
that
does
not
match
against
the
white
list
should
not
be
permitted
to
enter
into
the
system
.
Be
aware
of
the
threat
of
alternative
method
of
data
encoding
.
Regular
expressions
can
be
used
to
filter
out
backslash
.
Make
sure
you
decode
before
filtering
and
validating
the
untrusted
input
data
.
In
the
case
of
path
traversals
,
use
the
principle
of
least
privilege
when
determining
access
rights
to
file
systems
.
Do
not
allow
users
to
access
directories/files
that
they
should
not
access
.
Any
security
checks
should
occur
after
the
data
has
been
decoded
and
validated
as
correct
data
format
.
Do
not
repeat
decoding
process
,
if
bad
character
are
left
after
decoding
process
,
treat
the
data
as
suspicious
,
and
fail
the
validation
process
.
Avoid
making
decisions
based
on
names
of
resources
(
e.g
.
files
)
if
those
resources
can
have
alternate
names
.
