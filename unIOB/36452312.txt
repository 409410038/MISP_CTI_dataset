A
new
variant
of
the
URSNIF
malware
,
first
observed
in
June
2022
,
marks
an
important
milestone
for
the
tool
.
Unlike
previous
iterations
of
URSNIF
,
this
new
variant
,
dubbed
LDR4
,
is
not
a
banker
,
but
a
generic
backdoor
(
similar
to
the
short-lived
SAIGON
variant
)
,
which
may
have
been
purposely
built
to
enable
operations
like
ransomware
and
data
theft
extortion
.
This
is
a
significant
shift
from
the
malware
’
s
original
purpose
to
enable
banking
fraud
,
but
is
consistent
with
the
broader
threat
landscape
.
Mandiant
believes
that
the
same
threat
actors
who
operated
the
RM3
variant
of
URSNIF
are
likely
behind
LDR4
.
Given
the
success
and
sophistication
RM3
previously
had
,
LDR4
could
be
a
significantly
dangerous
variant—capable
of
distributing
ransomware—that
should
be
watched
closely
.
