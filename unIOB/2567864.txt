Client-side
Injection-induced
Buffer
Overflow
.
This
type
of
attack
exploits
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
in
targeted
client
software
through
injection
of
malicious
content
from
a
custom-built
hostile
service
.
The
targeted
client
software
communicates
with
an
external
server
.
The
targeted
client
software
has
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
.
The
client
software
should
not
install
untrusted
code
from
a
non-authenticated
server
.
The
client
software
should
have
the
latest
patches
and
should
be
audited
for
vulnerabilities
before
being
used
to
communicate
with
potentially
hostile
servers
.
Perform
input
validation
for
length
of
buffer
inputs
.
Use
a
language
or
compiler
that
performs
automatic
bounds
checking
.
Use
an
abstraction
library
to
abstract
away
risky
APIs
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
Compiler-based
canary
mechanisms
such
as
StackGuard
,
ProPolice
and
the
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
/GS
flag
.
Unless
this
provides
automatic
bounds
checking
,
it
is
not
a
complete
solution
.
Ensure
all
buffer
uses
are
consistently
bounds-checked
.
Use
OS-level
preventative
functionality
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
