Cross-Site
Scripting
(
XSS
)
An
adversary
embeds
malicious
scripts
in
content
that
will
be
served
to
web
browsers
.
The
goal
of
the
attack
is
for
the
target
software
,
the
client-side
browser
,
to
execute
the
script
with
the
users
'
privilege
level
.
An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
a
programs
'
vulnerabilities
that
are
brought
on
by
allowing
remote
hosts
to
execute
code
and
scripts
.
Web
browsers
,
for
example
,
have
some
simple
security
controls
in
place
,
but
if
a
remote
attacker
is
allowed
to
execute
scripts
(
through
injecting
them
in
to
user-generated
content
like
bulletin
boards
)
then
these
controls
may
be
bypassed
.
Further
,
these
attacks
are
very
difficult
for
an
end
user
to
detect
.
Target
client
software
must
be
a
client
that
allows
scripting
communication
from
remote
hosts
,
such
as
a
JavaScript-enabled
Web
Browser
.
Design
:
Use
browser
technologies
that
do
not
allow
client
side
scripting
.
Design
:
Utilize
strict
type
,
character
,
and
encoding
enforcement
Design
:
Server
side
developers
should
not
proxy
content
via
XHR
or
other
means
,
if
a
http
proxy
for
remote
content
is
setup
on
the
server
side
,
the
client
's
browser
has
no
way
of
discerning
where
the
data
is
originating
from
.
Implementation
:
Ensure
all
content
that
is
delivered
to
client
is
sanitized
against
an
acceptable
content
specification
.
Implementation
:
Perform
input
validation
for
all
remote
content
.
Implementation
:
Perform
output
validation
for
all
remote
content
.
Implementation
:
Session
tokens
for
specific
host
Implementation
:
Patching
software
.
There
are
many
attack
vectors
for
XSS
on
the
client
side
and
the
server
side
.
Many
vulnerabilities
are
fixed
in
service
packs
for
browser
,
web
servers
,
and
plug
in
technologies
,
staying
current
on
patch
release
that
deal
with
XSS
countermeasures
mitigates
this
.
