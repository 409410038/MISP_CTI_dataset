As
older
ANDROMEDA
malware
continues
to
spread
from
compromised
USB
devices
,
these
re-registered
domains
pose
a
risk
as
new
threat
actors
can
take
control
and
deliver
new
malware
to
victims
.
This
novel
technique
of
claiming
expired
domains
used
by
widely
distributed
,
financially
motivated
malware
can
enable
follow-on
compromises
at
a
wide
array
of
entities
.
Further
,
older
malware
and
infrastructure
may
be
more
likely
to
be
overlooked
by
defenders
triaging
a
wide
variety
of
alerts
.
This
is
Mandiant
’
s
first
observation
of
suspected
Turla
targeting
Ukrainian
entities
since
the
onset
of
the
invasion
.
The
campaign
’
s
operational
tactics
appear
consistent
with
Turla
’
s
considerations
for
planning
and
advantageous
positioning
to
achieve
initial
access
into
victim
systems
,
as
the
group
has
leveraged
USBs
and
conducted
extensive
victim
profiling
in
the
past
.
In
this
case
,
the
extensive
profiling
achieved
since
January
possibly
allowed
the
group
to
select
specific
victim
systems
and
tailor
their
follow-on
exploitation
efforts
to
gather
and
exfiltrate
information
of
strategic
importance
to
inform
Russian
priorities
.
However
,
we
note
some
elements
of
this
campaign
that
appear
to
be
a
departure
from
historical
Turla
operations
.
Both
KOPILUWAK
and
QUIETCANARY
were
downloaded
in
succession
at
various
times
,
which
may
suggest
the
group
was
operating
with
haste
or
less
concern
for
operational
security
,
experiencing
some
aspect
of
operational
deficiency
,
or
using
automated
tools
.
