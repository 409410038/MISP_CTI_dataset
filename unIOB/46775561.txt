The
WhatsApp
chats
of
those
who
were
known
to
be
successfully
targeted
reveal
that
the
attackers
were
repeatedly
engaging
with
the
targets
as
they
clicked
through
the
phishing
links
.
After
entering
their
credentials
on
the
phishing
page
,
targets
were
prompted
to
enter
a
code
on
the
2FA
bypass
page
,
which
the
attackers
used
to
gain
access
to
their
email
accounts
.
