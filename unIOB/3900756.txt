Remcos
is
a
legitimate
commercial
Remote
Access
Tool
(
RAT
)
created
by
the
security
company
Breaking
Security
.
It
was
first
released
in
2016
but
started
being
used
for
malicious
purposes
during
2017
.
This
is
a
powerful
tool
that
grants
the
capability
of
comprehensive
remote
surveillance
including
keylogging
,
activating
cameras
,
taking
screenshots
,
capturing
audio
,
and
monitoring
clipboard
activity
.
It
allows
threat
actors
to
quietly
transfer
files
to
and
from
the
client
machine
,
execute
scripts
,
create
shells
,
list
all
installed
software
,
edit
registry
and
more
.
Basically
,
a
hacker
â€™
s
dream
.
Widely
used
by
malicious
actors
,
this
tool
is
mostly
delivered
via
phishing
campaigns
.
While
just
last
year
an
analysis
of
version
3.4.0
was
published
by
Fortinet
,
we
recently
observed
version
4.2.0
,
which
was
released
in
December
20
,
2022
,
