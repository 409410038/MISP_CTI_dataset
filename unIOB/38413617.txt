The
Mitsol
Social
Post
Feed
plugin
for
WordPress
is
vulnerable
to
Stored
Cross-Site
Scripting
in
versions
up
to
,
and
including
,
1.10
due
to
insufficient
input
sanitization
and
output
escaping
on
the
application
id
parameters
.
This
makes
it
possible
for
authenticated
(
admin+
)
attackers
to
inject
arbitrary
web
scripts
in
pages
that
will
execute
whenever
a
user
accesses
an
injected
page
.
This
only
affects
multi-site
installations
and
installations
where
unfiltered_html
is
disabled
.
