utilizes
crafted
XML
user-controllable

allow
for
unauthorized
viewing
of

or
the
front-end
application
for
direct
XML
database
access
,
and
possibly
altering

information
.
XML

used
to
process
user
input
and
retrieve
information
stored
in
XML
documents
User-controllable
input

can
glean
information
about
the
nature
of
queries
from
descriptive
error
messages
.
Input
validation
must
be
coupled
with
customized
error
pages
that
inform
about
an
error
without
