ESET
researchers
have
discovered
a
new
Lazarus
Operation
DreamJob
campaign
targeting
Linux
users
.
Operation
DreamJob
is
the
name
for
a
series
of
campaigns
where
the
group
uses
social
engineering
techniques
to
compromise
its
targets
,
with
fake
job
offers
as
the
lure
.
In
this
case
,
we
were
able
to
reconstruct
the
full
chain
,
from
the
ZIP
file
that
delivers
a
fake
HSBC
job
offer
as
a
decoy
,
up
until
the
final
payload
:
the
SimplexTea
Linux
backdoor
distributed
through
an
OpenDrive
cloud
storage
account
.
To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
public
mention
of
this
major
North
Korea-aligned
threat
actor
using
Linux
malware
as
part
of
this
operation
.
Additionally
,
this
discovery
helped
us
confirm
with
a
high
level
of
confidence
that
the
recent
3CX
supply-chain
attack
was
in
fact
conducted
by
Lazarus
–
a
link
that
was
suspected
from
the
very
beginning
and
demonstrated
by
several
security
researchers
since
.
In
this
blogpost
,
we
corroborate
these
findings
and
provide
additional
evidence
about
the
connection
between
Lazarus
and
the
3CX
supply-chain
attack
.
