OS
Command
Injection
.
In
this
type
of
an
attack
,
an
adversary
injects
operating
system
commands
into
existing
application
functions
.
An
application
that
uses
untrusted
input
to
build
command
strings
is
vulnerable
.
An
adversary
can
leverage
OS
command
injection
in
an
application
to
elevate
privileges
,
execute
arbitrary
commands
and
compromise
the
underlying
operating
system
.
User
controllable
input
used
as
part
of
commands
to
the
underlying
operating
system
.
Use
language
APIs
rather
than
relying
on
passing
data
to
the
operating
system
shell
or
command
line
.
Doing
so
ensures
that
the
available
protection
mechanisms
in
the
language
are
intact
and
applicable
.
Filter
all
incoming
data
to
escape
or
remove
characters
or
strings
that
can
be
potentially
misinterpreted
as
operating
system
or
shell
commands
All
application
processes
should
be
run
with
the
minimal
privileges
required
.
Also
,
processes
must
shed
privileges
as
soon
as
they
no
longer
require
them
.
