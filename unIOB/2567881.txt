An
attacker
obtains
unauthorized
access
to
an
application
,
service
or
device
either
through
knowledge
of
the
inherent
weaknesses
of
an
authentication
mechanism
,
or
by
exploiting
a
flaw
in
the
authentication
scheme
's
implementation
.
In
such
an
attack
an
authentication
mechanism
is
functioning
but
a
carefully
controlled
sequence
of
events
causes
the
mechanism
to
grant
access
to
the
attacker
.
This
attack
may
exploit
assumptions
made
by
the
target
's
authentication
procedures
,
such
as
assumptions
regarding
trust
relationships
or
assumptions
regarding
the
generation
of
secret
values
.
This
attack
differs
from
Authentication
Bypass
attacks
in
that
Authentication
Abuse
allows
the
attacker
to
be
certified
as
a
valid
user
through
illegitimate
means
,
while
Authentication
Bypass
allows
the
user
to
access
protected
material
without
ever
being
certified
as
an
authenticated
user
.
This
attack
does
not
rely
on
prior
sessions
established
by
successfully
authenticating
users
,
as
relied
upon
for
the
``
Exploitation
of
Session
Variables
,
Resource
IDs
and
other
Trusted
Credentials
''
attack
patterns
.
An
authentication
mechanism
or
subsystem
implementing
some
form
of
authentication
such
as
passwords
,
digest
authentication
,
security
certificates
,
etc
.
which
is
flawed
in
some
way
.
