Input
Data
Manipulation
.
An
attacker
exploits
a
weakness
in
input
validation
by
controlling
the
format
,
structure
,
and
composition
of
data
to
an
input-processing
interface
.
By
supplying
input
of
a
non-standard
or
unexpected
form
an
attacker
can
adversely
impact
the
security
of
the
target
.
For
example
,
using
a
different
character
encoding
might
cause
dangerous
text
to
be
treated
as
safe
text
.
Alternatively
,
the
attacker
may
use
certain
flags
,
such
as
file
extensions
,
to
make
a
target
application
believe
that
provided
data
should
be
handled
using
a
certain
interpreter
when
the
data
is
not
actually
of
the
appropriate
type
.
This
can
lead
to
bypassing
protection
mechanisms
,
forcing
the
target
to
use
specific
components
for
input
processing
,
or
otherwise
causing
the
user
's
data
to
be
handled
differently
than
might
otherwise
be
expected
.
This
attack
differs
from
Variable
Manipulation
in
that
Variable
Manipulation
attempts
to
subvert
the
target
's
processing
through
the
value
of
the
input
while
Input
Data
Manipulation
seeks
to
control
how
the
input
is
processed
.
The
target
must
accept
user
data
for
processing
and
the
manner
in
which
this
data
is
processed
must
depend
on
some
aspect
of
the
format
or
flags
that
the
attacker
can
control
.
