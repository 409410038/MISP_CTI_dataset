In
our
previous
research
,
we
disclosed
and
analyzed
a
new
campaign
initiated
by
the
threat
actor
group
Earth
Preta
(
aka
Mustang
Panda
)
.
In
a
more
recent
campaign
we
’
ve
been
tracking
,
we
discovered
Earth
Preta
delivering
lure
archives
via
spear-phishing
emails
and
Google
Drive
links
.
After
months
of
investigation
,
we
found
that
several
undisclosed
malware
and
interesting
tools
used
for
exfiltration
purposes
were
used
in
this
campaign
.
We
also
observed
that
the
threat
actors
were
actively
changing
their
tools
,
tactics
,
and
procedures
(
TTPs
)
to
bypass
security
solutions
.
In
this
blog
entry
,
we
will
introduce
and
analyze
the
other
tools
and
malware
used
by
Earth
Preta
.
Infection
chain
As
we
previously
mentioned
in
our
past
blog
entry
,
the
entire
attack
begins
with
a
spear-phishing
email
.
After
a
long-term
investigation
into
the
attack
routine
,
we
’
ve
determined
that
the
full
infection
chain
works
as
follows
:
Figure

.
The
full

Figure

The
full

We
categorize
the
different
TTPs
into
six
stages
:
arrival
vectors
,
discovery
,
privilege
escalation
,
lateral
movement
,
command
and
control
(
C
&
C
)
and
exfiltration
,
respectively
.
In
our
previous
research
,
we
covered
most
of
the
new
TTPs
and
malware
during
the
first
stage
,
arrival
vectors
.
However
,
we
observed
that
some
of
TTPs
have
been
changed
.
In
the
following
sections
,
we
focus
on
the
updated
arrival
vectors
and
their
succeeding
stages
.
Arrival
vectors
We
previously
summarized
the
arrival
vectors
used
by
Earth
Preta
by
categorizing
them
into
three
types
(
DLL
sideloading
,
shortcut
links
,
and
fake
file
extensions
)
.
Starting
in
October
and
November
2022
,
we
observed
that
the
threat
actors
began
changing
their
TTPs
to
deploy
the
TONEINS
,
TONESHELL
,
and
PUBLOAD
malware
.
We
believe
that
the
threat
actors
are
employing
these
new
techniques
to
avoid
detection
.
Trojan.Win32.TONEINS
Based
on
our
earlier
observation
,
the
TONEINS
and
TONESHELL
malware
were
downloaded
from
the
Google
Drive
link
embedded
in
the
body
of
an
email
.
To
bypass
email-scanning
services
and
email
gateway
solutions
,
the
Google
Drive
link
has
now
been
embedded
in
a
lure
document
.
The
document
lures
users
into
downloading
a
malicious
password-protected
archive
with
the
embedded
link
.
The
files
can
then
be
extracted
inside
via
the
password
provided
in
the
document
.
By
using
this
technique
,
the
malicious
actor
behind
the
attack
can
successfully
bypass
scanning
services
.

After
analyzing
the
downloaded
archive
,
we
discovered
it
to
be
a
malicious
RAR
file
with
the
TONEINS
malware
libcef.dll
and
the
TONESHELL
malware
~List
of
terrorist

at
the

.
The
infection
flow
for
these
is
similar
to
the
arrival
vector
type
C
in
our
previous
report
,
with
the
only
difference
being
that
the
fake
.docx
files
have
XOR-encrypted
content
to
prevent
detection
.
For
example
,
~
$
Evidence
information.docx
is
a
file
disguising
itself
as
an
Office
Open
XML
document
.
As
such
,
it
seems
harmless
and
can
even
be
opened
by
using
decompression
software
such
as
7-Zip
.
We
found
that
the
threat
actors
have
hidden
a
PE
file
in
one
of
the
archive
’
s
ZIPFILERECORD
structures
.
The
TONEINS
malware
,
libcef.dll
,
will
decrypt
this
file
with
a
single
byte
in
XOR
operations
,
find
the
PE
header
,
and
drop
the
payload
to
the
specified
path
.

behaviors
of
the

flow
are
generally
the
same
as
those
in
our
previous
analysis
,
where
we
provide
more
details
.
Trojan.Win32.PUBLOAD
In
more
recent
cases
,
the
malware
PUBLOAD
was
also
being
delivered
through
Google
Drive
links
embedded
in
decoy
documents
.

Since
October
2022
,
we
have
been
observing
a
new
variant
of
PUBLOAD
,
which
uses
the
spoofed
HTTP
header
to
transfer
the
data
,
as
LAC
’
s
report
also
discusses
.
In
contrast
to
the
previous
PUBLOAD
variant
,
it
prepends
an
HTTP
header
with
a
legitimate-looking
host
name
to
the
packets
.
We
believe
that
the
threat
actors
are
trying
to
conceal
malicious
data
among
normal
traffic
.
The
data
in
the
HTTP
body
is
the
same
as
the
past
variant
,
which
has
the
same
magic
bytes
17
03
03
and
the
encrypted
victim
information
.
We
were
able
to
successfully
retrieve
the
payload
from
a
live
C
&
C
server
and
were
therefore
able
to
continue
our
analysis
.

are

and
if
the

In
summary
,
we
think
that
the
new
TONESHELL
and
PUBLOAD
archives
have
been
evolving
and
now
have
something
in
common
.
For
example
,
both
of
them
are
now
being
placed
in
decoy
documents
(
such
as
Google
Drive
links
)
in
order
to
bypass
antivirus
scanning
.
Discovery
Once
the
threat
actors
obtain
access
to
the
victim
’
s
environment
,
they
can
start
inspecting
the
environment
via
the
following
commands
:
net
user
net
user
<
username
>
net

<

Privilege
escalation
In
this
campaign
,
we
discovered
several
tools
used
for
UAC
bypass
in
Windows
10
.
We
will
go
into
detail
for
each
of
them
.
HackTool.Win
32.ABPASS
HackTool.Win32.ABPASS
is
a
tool
used
to
bypass
UAC
in
Windows
10
.
Based
on
our
analysis
,
it
reuses
codes
from
the
function
ucmShellRegModMethod3
,
which
is
from
a
famous
open-source
project
called
UACME
.
A
report
from
Sophos
introduces
this
tool
.
This
tool
accepts
an
argument
,
and
the
following
data
is
written
into
registry
:
Registry

>
-1001_Classes\ms-settings\CurVer
(
Default
)
aaabbb32
Table
3
.
Registry
keys
changed
by
ABPASS
It
also
changes
how
Windows
handles
the
ms-settings
protocol
—
in
this
case
,
the
string
ms-settings
is
a
Programmatic
Identifier
(
ProgID
)
.
If
the
CurVer
key
is
set
under
a
ProgID
,
it
will
be
used
for
versioning
and
mapping
the
current
ProgID
(
ms-settings
)
to
the
one
specified
in
the
CurVer
’
s
default
value
.
In
turn
,
the
behavior
of
ms-settings
is
redirected
to
the
custom
defined
ProgID
aaabbb32
.
It
also
sets
up
a
new
ProgID
aaabbb32
and
its
shell
open
command
.
Finally
,
fodhelper.exe
or
computerDefaults.exe
will
be
executed
to
trigger
the
ms-settings
protocol
.

HackTool.Win
32.CCPASS
HackTool.Win32.CCPASS
is
another
tool
that
is
also
used
for
Windows
10
UAC
bypass
and
similarly
reuses
codes
from
the
function
ucmMsStoreProtocolMethod
in
the
project
UACME
.

and

It
works
in
a
similar
way
to
ABPASS
.
However
,
unlike
ABPASS
,
it
hijacks
the
ms-windows-store
protocol
.
The
hack
tool
CCPASS
works
as
follows
:
It
disables
the
application
association
toasts
for
the
protocol
ms-windows-store
.
It
creates
a
new
Shell
in
the
registry
.
It
invokes
the
undocumented
API
UserAssocSet
to
update
the
file
association
.
It
executes
WSReset.exe
to
trigger
this
protocol
.
In
Windows
10
and
above
,
the
system
shows
a
new
toast
dialog
for
selecting
the
open
application
for
the
selected
file
type
.
To
hide
this
window
,
the
tool
explicitly
adds
new
entries
to
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ApplicationAssociationToasts
to
disable
all
toasts
related
to
the
protocol
ms-windows-store
.

Once
this
is
done
,
the
tool
starts
to
alter
the
shell
command
of
ms-windows-store
and
finally
triggers
it
using
WSReset.exe
.
SilentCleanup
In
Windows
10
,
there
is
a
native
Windows
service
called
“
SilentCleanup.
”
This
service
has
the
highest
privileges
that
can
be
abused
for
Windows
10
UAC
bypass
.
Normally
,
this
service
is
intended
for
running
%
windir
%
\system32\cleanmgr.exe
.
However
,
the
environment
variable
%
windir
%
can
be
hijacked
and
changed
to
any
path
to
achieve
privilege
escalation
.

In
this
stage
,
we
observed
certain
malware
such
as
HIUPAN
and
ACNSHELL
(
initially
introduced
and
analyzed
by
Mandiant
and
Sophos
)
being
used
to
install
themselves
to
removable
disks
and
create
a
reverse

The

which
then

The
string
U盘劫持
means
“

,
”
where
“
U

”
refers
to
removable

.
USB
Driver.exe
then
starts
checking
whether
it
is
properly
installed
.
If
it
is
installed
,
it
will
start
to
infect
more
removable

and
copy
files
to
a
folder
named
autorun.inf
.
If
it
is
not
installed
,
it
installs
itself
to
%

and
then
sets
the

.
Finally
,
the
ACNSHELL
malware
rzlog4cpp.dll
is
sideloaded
.
It
will
then

Backdoor.Win32.CLEXEC
The
file
name
of
the
backdoor
CLEXEC
is
SensorAware.dll
.
This
is
a
simple
backdoor
that
is
capable
of
executing
commands
and
clearing
event
logs
.

Backdoor.Win32.COOLCLIENT
The
backdoor
COOLCLIENT
was
first
introduced
in
a
report
from
Sophos
;
the
sample
mentioned
in
the
report
was
compiled
in
2021
.
In
our
case
,
the
COOLCLIENT
sample
we
analyzed
had
a
more
recent
compilation
time
in
2022
,
and
while
it
provides
the
same
functionalities
,
it
has
the
added
capability
to
open
a
decoy
document
(
work.pdf
)
when
the
current
process
name
has
“
.pdf
”
or
“
.jpg
”
file
extensions
.
It
contains
less
OutputDebugStrings
calls
.
Meanwhile
,
loader.ja
is
used
under
two
processes
:
One
is
under
googleupdate.exe
,
which
is
used
for
the
first
sideloading
.
The
second
is
under
winver.exe
,
which
is
injected
to
conduct
backdoor
behaviors
.
Furthermore
,
COOLCLIENT
applies
obfuscation
techniques
that
we
discuss
in
later
sections
.

.
Based
on
some
internal
strings
and
the
APIs
used
by
Earth

,
the
functionalities
of

Backdoor.Win32.TROCLIENT
The
backdoor
TROCLIENT
,
which
was
also
first
disclosed
in
Sophos
’
s
report
,
is
similar
to
COOLCLIENT
.
However
,
this
backdoor
has
an
anti-debugging
technique
,
which
will
check
if
the
running
processes
have
the
strings
dbg.exe

Comparison
of
COOLCLIENT
and
TROCLIENT
In
addition
to
the
aforementioned
malware
,
we
also
found
several
shellcode
loaders
for
PlugX
.
Since
it
is
a
known
malware
family
,
we
will
not
expand
on
its
details
in
this
blog
entry
.
Exfiltration
Based
on
our
telemetry
,
we
found
that
Earth
Preta
used
multiple
approaches
to
exfiltrate
sensitive
data
from
the
victims
.
For
example
,
in
some
cases
,
we
observed
that
WinRAR
and
curl
(
or
cURL
)
were
leveraged
to
collect
and
transfer
data
to
the
threat
actor
’
s
server
.
After
further
investigation
,
we
even
found
some
previously
unseen
pieces
of
malware
that
were
used
to
collect
data
in
a
custom-made
file
format
.
In
the
following
sections
,
we
share
the
details
of
the
unique
exfiltration
toolsets
developed
by
Earth
Preta
.
WinRAR
and
curl
According
to
some
of
our
monitoring
logs
,
the
threat
actors
abused
the
installed
WinRAR
binary
and
the
uploaded
curl
executable
to
exfiltrate
the
files
(
Figure
30
shows
the
executed
command
)
.
Note
that
the
executable
log.log
is
a
legitimate
curl
binary
.
All
the
exfiltrated
data
was
collected
and
sent
back
to
the
threat
actor-controlled
FTP
(
File
Transfer
Protocol
)
server
.

Exfiltrate
data
using
WinRAR
and
curl
In
some
cases
,
we
accidentally
stumbled
on
the
account
and
password
of
the
FTP
server
.
Upon
checking
the
FTP
server
,
we
learned
that
the
threat
actors
focused
on
sensitive
and
confidential
documents
,
most
of
which
were
compressed
and
protected
with
a
password
.
Based
on
our
observations
,
the
documents
were
organized
via
the
categorization
of
the
victim
’
s
host
name
and
disk
drive
.

HackTool.Win32.NUPAKAGE
Apart
from
well-known
legitimate
tools
,
the
threat
actors
also
crafted
highly
customized
tools
used
for
exfiltration
.
We
named
this
malware
“
NUPAKAGE
,
''
a
name
derived
from
its
unique
PDB
string
,
D
:
\Project\NEW_PACKAGE_FILE\Release\NEW_PACKAGE_FILE.pdb
.
The
NUPAKAGE
malware
needs
a
unique
passcode
to
be
executed
,
with
the
exfiltrated
data
being
wrapped
in
a
custom
file
format
.
It
seems
that
the
threat
actors
are
continuously
updating
this
tool
to
provide
more
flexibility
and
lower
the
possibility
of
detection
,
including
adding
more
command-line
arguments
and
obfuscation
mechanisms
.
By
default
,
it
only
collects
documents
,
including
the
files
with
the
following
extensions
:
.doc
.docx
.xls
.xlsx
.ppt
.pptx
.pdf
It
avoids
collecting
documents
with
file
names
starting
with
“
$
”
or
“
~
”
since
these
types
of
documents
are
usually
either
temporary
files
generated
by
the
system
or
PE
files
pretending
to
be
decoy
documents
(
as
we
discussed
in
the
arrival
vectors
section
)
.
The
usage
of
this

Arguments
of
the
NUPAKAGE
malware
Every
NUPAKAGE
malware
needs
a
unique
passcode
as
its
first
argument
to
continue
execution
.
As
Figure
32
shows
,
it
first
checks
if
the
passcode
exists
.
If
not
,
the
malware
execution
procedure
will
terminate

file
xxx.zip
is
a
logging
file
with
a
fake
ZIP
header
prepended
at
offset
0x0
and
taking
up
the
first
0x100
bytes
.
Starting
from
the

,
the
logging

are
encrypted
with
a
single
byte
in
XOR
operations
as
shown

results
as

,
much
of
the

of
the
exfiltrated
data
is
saved
,
including
the
original
file
path
,
the
original
file
size
,
and
the
compressed
file
size
.
We
believe
that
the
threat
actors
use
it
to
further
track
which
files
have
been
processed
.
For
security
researchers
,
this
logging
file
also
helps
reveal
how
much
data
is
exfiltrated
and
provides
information
on

The
file
with
a
.z
extension
is
a
blob
of
exfiltrated
data
within
a
self-defined
file
format
.
The
NUPAKAGE
malware
first
generates
a
key
blob
randomly
,
with
the
key
being
encrypted
in
a
custom
algorithm
.
After
,
it
stores
the
encrypted
key
blob
into
the
first
0x80
bytes
of
the
file
with
the
.z
extension
.
Starting
from
the
offset
0x80
,
there
exists
a
long
array
of
all
the
exfiltrated
data
.
Much
of
the
information
from
the
exfiltrated
files
are
saved
,
such
as
the
MD5
hash
,
the
length
of
the
file
name
,
the
compressed
file
size
,
the
original
file
size
,
the
file
name
,
and
the
file
’
s
content
.
To
separate
the
file
blobs
,
it
puts

are
being
adopted
to

HackTool.Win32.ZPAKAGE
ZPAKAGE
is
another
example
of
custom
malware
used
for
packing
files
;
it
also
works
similarly
to
NUPAKAGE
.
It
also
needs
a
passcode
to
ensure
that
it
is
being
used
as
intended
.
In
the
example
shown
in
Figure
36
,
the
passcode
is
“
start
”
.

ZPAKAGE
also
shows
similar
behaviors
to
NUPAKAGE
.
For
instance
,
it
also
avoids
files
with
names
starting
with
“
$
”
or
“
~
”
.
In
addition
,
it
generates
two
files
,
one
with
a
.z
extension
and
another
with
a
.zip
extension
.
The
file
with
a
.z
extension
is
the
exfiltrated
data
blob
and
the
file
with
a
.zip
extension
is
the
logging
file
.
In
the
generated
file
with
a
.z
extension
,
the
exfiltrated
files
will
be
compressed
by
the
zlib
algorithm
to
minimize
the
file
size
.
It
also
defines
a
Boolean
field
“
type
”
for
storage
,
whether
a
file
is
compressed
or
not
.
If
a
file
is
compressed
and
its
file
size
is
less
than
the
original
one
,
the
type
will
be
1
.
Otherwise
,
the
type
will
be
set
to
0
,
and
the
original
file
content
will
be
chosen
instead
of
the
compressed
one
.
Regardless
of
whether
the
file
content
is
compressed
or
not
,
it
will
be
encrypted
in
XOR
operations
with
a
specific
string
,
qwerasdf

Threat

Since
October
2022
,
the
threat
actors
have
changed
their
TTPs

have
started
using
password-protected

.
For
example
,
we
found
a
TONEINS

on

that
can
’
t
be

to
any

However
,
we
observed
two

with
the

and

As
mentioned
in

,
the

are
normally
embedded
in
the
fake

Unfortunately
,
we
didn

t
have
the

so
we
were
unable
to
decompress
it
.
But
it
has
an
interesting
execution

in
the
“

tab
,
which
is
a
document

named

The
new
arrival
vector
flow
is
similar
to
the
one
we
introduced
in
the
arrival

section
:
Victims
will
receive
and
interact
with
a
decoy
document
containing
a
Google
Drive
link
and
a
corresponding
password
instead
of
an
archive
download
link
embedded
in
the
email
.
As
for
why
the
password-protected
archive
has
the
execution
parent
,
upon
checking
the
sandbox
execution
behaviors
of
Letter
Head.docx
on
VirusTotal
,
we
discovered
that
the
VirusTotal
sandbox
will
select
any
link
embedded
in
the
document
.
This
leads
to
the
opening
of
an
Internet
Explorer
window
with
the
file
download
prompt
.

in
the

even
before
the

selects
the

As
a

,
the

we
see
a

Since
the

,
Letter

It
’
s
interesting
to
note
that
the
threat
actors
use
date
and
time
strings
written
in
the
same
format
(
DD-MM-YYYY
)
as
the

in
all

.
Connecting
the
Dots
During
our
investigation
,
we
observed
some
data
points
that
connect
to
the
same
personnel
.
For
example
,
we
found
a
specific
name
“
TaoZongjie
”
among
the
different
malware
samples
we
collected
.
In
addition
,
the
GitHub
repository
named
“

,
”
mentioned
in
Avast
’
s
December
2022
report
,
￼hosted
multiple
pieces
of
malware
,
including
TONESHELL
.
We
also
observed
that
the
obfuscation
methods
have
similarities
among
the
different
malwares
.
User

We
found
some
samples
sharing
the
same
special

”
including
the
Cobalt

malware
,
a
Windows

,
and
the

While
hunting
samples
related
to
this
campaign
,
we
came
across
a
tweet
about
Cobalt
Strike
posted
in
April
2021
.
At
first
glance
,
Cobalt
Strike
was
used
in
a
manner
similar
to
this
campaign
,
including
the
use
of
DLL
sideloading
,
the
use
of
a
Google

link
for
delivery
,
and
the
creation
of
a
schedule

.

The
infection

is
as
follows
:
The
archive
file
is
delivered
through
a
Google

link
,
which
contains
a
legitimate
EXE
file
,
a
malicious
DLL
file
,
and
a
decoy
document
written
in
Burmese
.
Once
the
malicious
DLL
is
sideloaded
,
it
will
drop
the
legitimate
EXE
file
and
the
malicious
DLL
file
,
which
are
embedded
in
the
resource
section
of
the
DLL

.
In
this
sample
,
the

:
Taozongjie
is
being
used
as
the

we
found
two

Both
share
the

a

hidden
in
a

file
)
as
the
one
we
referred
to
in
the

.
These

ended
up
being
the

is
a
novel
malware
that
communicates
over
the
MQTT
protocol
.
In
March
2023
,
ESET
published
a
detailed
technical
report
on
this
backdoor
,
which
it
named
“
MQsTTang.
”
Beginning
in
January
,
we
discovered
that
MQsTTang
was
being
used
as
the
new
arrival
vector
in
some
of
incidents
we
encountered
,
specifically
in
campaigns
targeting
individuals
involved
with
government
entities
.
This
backdoor
is
unique
because
it
communicates
to
its
C

C
servers
over
the
MQTT
protocol
,
which
is
commonly
used
in
internet-of-things
(
IoT

.
Malicious
actors
using
this
technique
can
effectively
hide

the

Conclusion
Over
the
past
year
,
security
researchers
have
been
discovering
and
analyzing
Earth
Preta
’
s
campaigns
and
toolsets
.
We
were
able
to
attribute
some
of
these
to
Earth
Preta
based
on
similarities
among
the
TTPs
,
the
malware
being
used
,
and
the
timeline
of
the
campaigns
.
Starting
October
2022
,
the
threat
actors
changed
the
arrival
vector
of
the
TONEINS
,
TONESHELL
,
and
PUBLOAD
malware
.
Instead
of
attaching
malicious
archives
or
Google
Drive
links
to
an
email
,
they
now
embed
the
download
link
in
another
decoy
document
and
add
a
password
to
the
archive
.
Based
on
our
observations
,
Earth
Preta
tends
to
hide
malicious
payloads
in
fake
files
,
disguising
them
as
legitimate
ones
—
a
technique
that
has
been
proven
effective
for
avoiding
detection
.
As
for
privilege
escalation
,
the
threat
actors
tend
to
reuse
codes
copied
from
open-source
repositories
.
Meanwhile
,
they
developed
customized
toolsets
designed
to
collect
confidential
documents
in
the
exfiltration
stage
.
Overall
,
we
believe
that
Earth
Preta
is
a
capable
and
organized
threat
actor
that
is
continuously
honing
its
TTPs
,
strengthening
its
development
capabilities
,
and
building
a
versatile
arsenal
of
tools
and
malware
.
To
help
prevent
potential
threats
such
as
the
one
posed
by
advanced
persistent
threat
(
APT
)
groups
,
we
suggest
that
organizations
conduct
phishing
awareness
training
for
their
employees
and
partners
to
stress
the
importance
of
caution
when
opening
emails
,
particularly
those
messages
from
unfamiliar
senders
or
with
unknown
subjects
.
To
assist
organizations
in
protecting
themselves
against
sophisticated
threats
,
we
recommend
adopting
a
comprehensive
security
strategy
that
employs
advanced
technologies
capable
of
identifying
and
halting
such
threats
across
multiple
channels
,
including
endpoints
,
servers
,
networks
,
and
email
communications
.
