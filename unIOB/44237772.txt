These
IOCs
come
from
a
very
comprehensive
report
(
35
pages
)
by
PRODAFT
regarding
the
tactics
,
techniques
and
procedures
(
TTPs
)
used
by
the
financially
motivated
group
WIZARD
SPIDER
.
This
group
is
known
by
the
various
malware
variants
it
uses
(
Ryuk
,
Trickbot
,
and
Conti
,
among
others
)
.
The
report
contains
information
about
the
group
's
distribution
mechanism
,
locker
sample
,
intrusion
server
,
extortion
server
,
backup
storage
,
and
the
hash
cracking
station
.
This
cybercrime
group
has
been
firstly
identified
in
2017
,
and
may
be
one
of
the
wealthiest
groups
currently
in
operation
,
with
total
assets
easily
in
excess
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
.
The
group
's
extraordinary
profitability
allows
its
leaders
to
invest
in
illicit
research
and
development
initiatives
.
Wizard
Spider
is
fully
capable
of
hiring
specialist
talent
,
building
new
digital
infrastructure
,
and
purchasing
access
to
advanced
exploits
.
It
would
also
have
hired
telephone
operators
to
cold-call
victims
and
scare
them
into
paying
.
In
terms
of
initial
infection
,
the
attackers
majoritarily
use
malspam
campaigns
with
malware
like
Qakbot
and
SystemBC
.
But
they
also
directly
scanned
and
exploited
hundreds
of
VMware
vCenter
servers
with
Log4j
(
CVE-2021-44228
)
vulnerabilities
.
They
reportedly
have
a
specific
set
of
tools
to
encrypt
resources
in
virtual
environments
.
