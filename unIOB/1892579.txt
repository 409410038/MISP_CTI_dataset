Microsoft
Threat
Intelligence
Center
(
MSTIC
)
has
identified
evidence
of
a
destructive
malware
operation
targeting
multiple
organizations
in
Ukraine
.
This
malware
first
appeared
on
victim
systems
in
Ukraine
on
January
13
,
2022
.
Microsoft
is
aware
of
the
ongoing
geopolitical
events
in
Ukraine
and
surrounding
region
and
encourages
organizations
to
use
the
information
in
this
post
to
proactively
protect
from
any
malicious
activity
.
While
our
investigation
is
continuing
,
MSTIC
has
not
found
any
notable
associations
between
this
observed
activity
,
tracked
as
DEV-0586
,
and
other
known
activity
groups
.
MSTIC
assesses
that
the
malware
,
which
is
designed
to
look
like
ransomware
but
lacking
a
ransom
recovery
mechanism
,
is
intended
to
be
destructive
and
designed
to
render
targeted
devices
inoperable
rather
than
to
obtain
a
ransom
.
At
present
and
based
on
Microsoft
visibility
,
our
investigation
teams
have
identified
the
malware
on
dozens
of
impacted
systems
and
that
number
could
grow
as
our
investigation
continues
.
These
systems
span
multiple
government
,
non-profit
,
and
information
technology
organizations
,
all
based
in
Ukraine
.
We
do
not
know
the
current
stage
of
this
attacker
’
s
operational
cycle
or
how
many
other
victim
organizations
may
exist
in
Ukraine
or
other
geographic
locations
.
However
,
it
is
unlikely
these
impacted
systems
represent
the
full
scope
of
impact
as
other
organizations
are
reporting
.
Given
the
scale
of
the
observed
intrusions
,
MSTIC
is
not
able
to
assess
intent
of
the
identified
destructive
actions
but
does
believe
these
actions
represent
an
elevated
risk
to
any
government
agency
,
non-profit
or
enterprise
located
or
with
systems
in
Ukraine
.
We
strongly
encourage
all
organizations
to
immediately
conduct
a
thorough
investigation
and
to
implement
defenses
using
the
information
provided
in
this
post
.
MSTIC
will
update
this
blog
as
we
have
additional
information
to
share
.
As
with
any
observed
nation-state
actor
activity
,
Microsoft
directly
and
proactively
notifies
customers
that
have
been
targeted
or
compromised
,
providing
them
with
the
information
they
need
to
guide
their
investigations
.
MSTIC
is
also
actively
working
with
members
of
the
global
security
community
and
other
strategic
partners
to
share
information
that
can
address
this
evolving
threat
through
multiple
channels
.
Microsoft
uses
DEV-
#
#
#
#
designations
as
a
temporary
name
given
to
an
unknown
,
emerging
,
or
a
developing
cluster
of
threat
activity
,
allowing
MSTIC
to
track
it
as
a
unique
set
of
information
until
we
reach
a
high
confidence
about
the
origin
or
identity
of
the
actor
behind
the
activity
.
Once
it
meets
the
criteria
,
a
DEV
is
converted
to
a
named
actor
or
merged
with
existing
actors
.
