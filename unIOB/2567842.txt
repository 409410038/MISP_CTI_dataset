Collect
Data
from
Registries
An
adversary
exploits
a
weakness
in
authorization
to
gather
system-specific
data
and
sensitive
information
within
a
registry
(
e.g.
,
Windows
Registry
,
Mac
plist
)
.
These
contain
information
about
the
system
configuration
,
software
,
operating
system
,
and
security
.
The
adversary
can
leverage
information
gathered
in
order
to
carry
out
further
attacks
.
The
adversary
must
have
obtained
logical
access
to
the
system
by
some
means
(
e.g.
,
via
obtained
credentials
or
planting
malware
on
the
system
)
.
The
adversary
must
have
capability
to
navigate
the
operating
system
to
peruse
the
registry
.
Employ
a
robust
and
layered
defensive
posture
in
order
to
prevent
unauthorized
users
on
your
system
.
Employ
robust
identification
and
audit/blocking
via
whitelisting
of
applications
on
your
system
.
Unnecessary
applications
,
utilities
,
and
configurations
will
have
a
presence
in
the
system
registry
that
can
be
leveraged
by
an
adversary
through
this
attack
pattern
.
