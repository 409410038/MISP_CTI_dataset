An
attacker
employs
forceful
browsing
to
access
portions
of
a
website
that
are
otherwise
unreachable
through
direct
URL
entry
.
Usually
,
a
front
controller
or
similar
design
pattern
is
employed
to
protect
access
to
portions
of
a
web
application
.
Forceful
browsing
enables
an
attacker
to
access
information
,
perform
privileged
operations
and
otherwise
reach
sections
of
the
web
application
that
have
been
improperly
protected
.
The
forcibly
browseable
pages
or
accessible
resources
must
be
discoverable
and
improperly
protected
.
Authenticate
request
to
every
resource
.
In
addition
,
every
page
or
resource
must
ensure
that
the
request
it
is
handling
has
been
made
in
an
authorized
context
.
Forceful
browsing
can
also
be
made
difficult
to
a
large
extent
by
not
hard-coding
names
of
application
pages
or
resources
.
This
way
,
the
attacker
can
not
figure
out
,
from
the
application
alone
,
the
resources
available
from
the
present
context
.
