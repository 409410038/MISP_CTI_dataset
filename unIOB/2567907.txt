Fuzzing
for
garnering
other
adjacent
user/sensitive
data
An
attacker
who
is
authorized
to
send
queries
to
a
target
sends
variants
of
expected
queries
in
the
hope
that
these
modified
queries
might
return
information
(
directly
or
indirectly
through
error
logs
)
beyond
what
the
expected
set
of
queries
should
provide
.
Many
client
applications
use
specific
query
templates
when
interacting
with
a
server
and
often
automatically
fill
in
specific
fields
or
attributes
.
For
example
,
a
client
that
queries
an
employee
database
might
have
templates
such
that
the
user
only
supplies
the
target
's
name
and
the
template
dictates
the
fields
to
be
returned
(
location
,
position
in
the
company
,
phone
number
,
etc.
)
.
If
the
server
does
not
verify
that
the
query
matches
one
of
the
expected
templates
,
an
attacker
who
is
allowed
to
send
normal
queries
could
modify
their
query
to
try
to
return
additional
information
.
In
the
above
example
,
additional
information
might
include
social
security
numbers
or
salaries
.
Fuzzing
techniques
involve
sending
random
or
malformed
messages
to
a
target
and
monitoring
the
target
's
response
.
In
this
particular
attack
,
the
fuzzing
is
applied
to
the
format
of
the
expected
templates
,
creating
variants
that
request
additional
information
,
exclude
limiting
clauses
,
or
alter
fields
that
identify
the
requester
in
order
to
subvert
access
controls
.
The
attacker
may
not
know
the
names
of
fields
to
request
or
how
other
modifications
will
affect
the
server
response
,
but
by
attempting
multiple
plausible
variants
,
they
might
eventually
trigger
a
server
response
that
divulges
sensitive
information
.
Other
possible
outcomes
include
server
crashes
and
resource
consumption
if
the
unexpected
queries
cause
the
server
to
enter
an
unstable
state
or
perform
excessive
computation
.
The
server
must
assume
that
the
queries
it
receives
follow
specific
templates
and/or
have
fields
or
attributes
that
follow
specific
procedures
.
The
server
must
process
queries
that
it
receives
without
adequately
checking
or
sanitizing
queries
to
ensure
they
follow
these
templates
.
