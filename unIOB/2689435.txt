``
Since
December
2021
,
multiple
threat
actor
groups
have
exploited
Log4Shell
on
unpatched
,
public-facing
VMware
Horizon
and
UAG
servers
.
As
part
of
this
exploitation
,
suspected
APT
actors
implanted
loader
malware
on
compromised
systems
with
embedded
executables
enabling
remote
command
and
control
(
C2
)
.
In
one
confirmed
compromise
,
these
APT
actors
were
able
to
move
laterally
inside
the
network
,
gain
access
to
a
disaster
recovery
network
,
and
collect
and
exfiltrate
sensitive
data
.
