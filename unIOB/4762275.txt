Mandiant
has
observed
a
new
ALPHV
(
aka
BlackCat
ransomware
)
ransomware
affiliate
,
tracked
as
UNC4466
,
target
publicly
exposed
Veritas
Backup
Exec
installations
,
vulnerable
to
CVE-2021-27876
,
CVE-2021-27877
and
CVE-2021-27878
,
for
initial
access
to
victim
environments
.
A
commercial
Internet
scanning
service
identified
over
8,500
installations
of
Veritas
Backup
Exec
instances
that
are
currently
exposed
to
the
internet
,
some
of
which
may
still
be
unpatched
and
vulnerable
.
Previous
ALPHV
intrusions
investigated
by
Mandiant
primarily
originated
from
stolen
credentials
suggesting
a
shift
to
opportunistic
targeting
of
known
vulnerabilities
.
This
blog
post
covers
the
UNC4466
attack
lifecycle
,
indicators
,
and
detection
opportunities
.
ALPHV
emerged
in
November
2021
as
a
ransomware-as-a-service
that
some
researchers
have
claimed
is
the
successor
to
BLACKMATTER
and
DARKSIDE
ransomware
.
While
some
ransomware
operators
enacted
rules
to
avoid
impacting
critical
infrastructure
and
health
entities
,
ALPHV
has
continued
to
target
these
sensitive
industries
.
