Object
Relational
Mapping
Injection
An
attacker
leverages
a
weakness
present
in
the
database
access
layer
code
generated
with
an
Object
Relational
Mapping
(
ORM
)
tool
or
a
weakness
in
the
way
that
a
developer
used
a
persistence
framework
to
inject
his
or
her
own
SQL
commands
to
be
executed
against
the
underlying
database
.
The
attack
here
is
similar
to
plain
SQL
injection
,
except
that
the
application
does
not
use
JDBC
to
directly
talk
to
the
database
,
but
instead
it
uses
a
data
access
layer
generated
by
an
ORM
tool
or
framework
(
e.g
.
Hibernate
)
.
While
most
of
the
time
code
generated
by
an
ORM
tool
contains
safe
access
methods
that
are
immune
to
SQL
injection
,
sometimes
either
due
to
some
weakness
in
the
generated
code
or
due
to
the
fact
that
the
developer
failed
to
use
the
generated
access
methods
properly
,
SQL
injection
is
still
possible
.
An
application
uses
data
access
layer
generated
by
an
ORM
tool
or
framework
An
application
uses
user
supplied
data
in
queries
executed
against
the
database
The
separation
between
data
plane
and
control
plane
is
not
ensured
,
through
either
developer
error
or
an
underlying
weakness
in
the
data
access
layer
code
generation
framework
Remember
to
understand
how
to
use
the
data
access
methods
generated
by
the
ORM
tool
/
framework
properly
in
a
way
that
would
leverage
the
built-in
security
mechanisms
of
the
framework
Ensure
to
keep
up
to
date
with
security
relevant
updates
to
the
persistence
framework
used
within
your
application
.
