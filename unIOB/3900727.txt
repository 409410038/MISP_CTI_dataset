Gamaredon
Group
has
been
actively
targeting
the
Ukrainian
government
lately
,
relying
on
the
infrastructure
of
the
popular
messaging
service
Telegram
to
bypass
traditional
network
traffic
detection
techniques
without
raising
obvious
flags
.

BlackBerry
uncovered
a
new
Gamaredon
campaign
that
relied
on
a
multi-stage
Telegram
scheme
to
first
profile
potential
victims

and
then
deliver
the
final
payload
along
with
the
malicious
command-and-control
(

)
.
This

provides
information
about
the
recent
network
infrastructure
from
Crimea

Group
uses
