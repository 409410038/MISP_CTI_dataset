Ransomware
attacks
have
been
rising
in
recent
years
,
with
the
frequency
of
attacks
increasing
.
In
2021
,
several
high-profile
ransomware
attacks
made
headlines
,
such
as
the
attack
on
the
Colonial
Pipeline
.
This
attack
resulted
in
the
temporary
shutdown
of
the
pipeline
,
which
caused
fuel
shortages
and
panic
buying
in
some
areas
.
This
incident
could
have
led
to
a
crisis
within
the
country
.
In
addition
to
targeting
large
companies
,
ransomware
attacks
are
frequently
directed
at
small
businesses
,
hospitals
,
and
other
organizations
with
less
robust
cybersecurity
measures
.
In
November
2022
,
the
Royal
Ransomware
group
was
the
most
actively
operating
ransomware
group
,
and
the
group
is
continuing
to
damage
organizations
.
