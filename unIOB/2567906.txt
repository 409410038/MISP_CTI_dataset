SQL
Injection
through
SOAP
Parameter
Tampering
An
attacker
modifies
the
parameters
of
the
SOAP
message
that
is
sent
from
the
service
consumer
to
the
service
provider
to
initiate
a
SQL
injection
attack
.
On
the
service
provider
side
,
the
SOAP
message
is
parsed
and
parameters
are
not
properly
validated
before
being
used
to
access
a
database
in
a
way
that
does
not
use
parameter
binding
,
thus
enabling
the
attacker
to
control
the
structure
of
the
executed
SQL
query
.
This
pattern
describes
a
SQL
injection
attack
with
the
delivery
mechanism
being
a
SOAP
message
.
SOAP
messages
are
used
as
a
communication
mechanism
in
the
system
SOAP
parameters
are
not
properly
validated
at
the
service
provider
The
service
provider
does
not
properly
utilize
parameter
binding
when
building
SQL
queries
Properly
validate
and
sanitize/reject
user
input
at
the
service
provider
.
Ensure
that
prepared
statements
or
other
mechanism
that
enables
parameter
binding
is
used
when
accessing
the
database
in
a
way
that
would
prevent
the
attackers
'
supplied
data
from
controlling
the
structure
of
the
executed
query
.
At
the
database
level
,
ensure
that
the
database
user
used
by
the
application
in
a
particular
context
has
the
minimum
needed
privileges
to
the
database
that
are
needed
to
perform
the
operation
.
When
possible
,
run
queries
against
pre-generated
views
rather
than
the
tables
directly
.
