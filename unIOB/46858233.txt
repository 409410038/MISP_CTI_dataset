a
full
analysis

.
Rapid7
is
aware
of
at
least
one
recent
incident
where
a
customer
was
compromised
via
CVE-2022-47986
.
In
light
of
active
exploitation
and
the
fact
that
Aspera
Faspex
is
typically
installed
on
the
network
perimeter
,
we
strongly
recommend
patching
on
an
emergency
basis
,
without
waiting
for
a
typical
patch
cycle
to
occur
.
