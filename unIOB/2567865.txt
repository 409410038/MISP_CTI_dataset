Overflow
Binary
Resource
File
An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
in
the
handling
of
binary
resources
.
Binary
resources
may
include
music
files
like
MP3
,
image
files
like
JPEG
files
,
and
any
other
binary
file
.
These
attacks
may
pass
unnoticed
to
the
client
machine
through
normal
usage
of
files
,
such
as
a
browser
loading
a
seemingly
innocent
JPEG
file
.
This
can
allow
the
attacker
access
to
the
execution
stack
and
execute
arbitrary
code
in
the
target
process
.
This
attack
pattern
is
a
variant
of
standard
buffer
overflow
attacks
using
an
unexpected
vector
(
binary
files
)
to
wrap
its
attack
and
open
up
a
new
attack
vector
.
The
attacker
is
required
to
either
directly
serve
the
binary
content
to
the
victim
,
or
place
it
in
a
locale
like
a
MP3
sharing
application
,
for
the
victim
to
download
.
The
attacker
then
is
notified
upon
the
download
or
otherwise
locates
the
vulnerability
opened
up
by
the
buffer
overflow
.
Target
software
processes
binary
resource
files
.
Target
software
contains
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
reachable
through
input
from
a
user-controllable
binary
resource
file
.
Perform
appropriate
bounds
checking
on
all
buffers
.
Design
:
Enforce
principle
of
least
privilege
Design
:
Static
code
analysis
Implementation
:
Execute
program
in
less
trusted
process
space
environment
,
do
not
allow
lower
integrity
processes
to
write
to
higher
integrity
processes
Implementation
:
Keep
software
patched
to
ensure
that
known
vulnerabilities
are
not
available
for
attackers
to
target
on
host
.
