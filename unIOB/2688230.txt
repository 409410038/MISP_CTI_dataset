The
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
(
FBI
)
,
the
Cybersecurity
and
Infrastructure
Security
Agency
(
CISA
)
,
the
Department
of
the
Treasury
,
and
the
Financial
Crimes
Enforcement
Network
(
FinCEN
)
are
releasing
this
CSA
to
provide
information
on
MedusaLocker
ransomware
.
Observed
as
recently
as
May
2022
,
MedusaLocker
actors
predominantly
rely
on
vulnerabilities
in
Remote
Desktop
Protocol
(
RDP
)
to
access
victims
’
networks
.
The
MedusaLocker
actors
encrypt
the
victim
's
data
and
leave
a
ransom
note
with
communication
instructions
in
every
folder
containing
an
encrypted
file
.
The
note
directs
victims
to
provide
ransomware
payments
to
a
specific
Bitcoin
wallet
address
.
MedusaLocker
appears
to
operate
as
a
Ransomware-as-a-Service
(
RaaS
)
model
based
on
the
observed
split
of
ransom
payments
.
Typical
RaaS
models
involve
the
ransomware
developer
and
various
affiliates
that
deploy
the
ransomware
on
victim
systems
.
MedusaLocker
ransomware
payments
appear
to
be
consistently
split
between
the
affiliate
,
who
receives
55
to
60
percent
of
the
ransom
;
and
the
developer
,
who
receives
the
remainder
.
