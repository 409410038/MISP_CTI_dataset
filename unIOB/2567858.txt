Buffer
Overflow
in
an
API
Call
.
This
attack
targets
libraries
or
shared
code
modules
which
are
vulnerable
to
buffer
overflow
attacks
.
An
attacker
who
has
access
to
an
API
may
try
to
embed
malicious
code
in
the
API
function
call
and
exploit
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
in
the
function's
implementation
.
All
clients
that
make
use
of
the
code
library
thus
become
vulnerable
by
association
.
This
has
a
very
broad
effect
on
security
across
a
system
,
usually
affecting
more
than
one
software
process
.
The
target
host
exposes
an
API
to
the
user
.
One
or
more
API
functions
exposed
by
the
target
host
has
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
.
Use
a
language
or
compiler
that
performs
automatic
bounds
checking
.
Use
secure
functions
not
vulnerable
to
buffer
overflow
.
If
you
have
to
use
dangerous
functions
,
make
sure
that
you
do
boundary
checking
.
Compiler-based
canary
mechanisms
such
as
StackGuard
,
ProPolice
and
the
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
/GS
flag
.
Unless
this
provides
automatic
bounds
checking
,
it
is
not
a
complete
solution
.
Use
OS-level
preventative
functionality
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
