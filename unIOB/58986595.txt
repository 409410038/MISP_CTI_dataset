On

,
Fortinet
silently
patched
a
purported
critical
remote
code
execution
(
RCE
)
vulnerability
in
Fortigate
SSL
VPN
firewalls
.
The
flaw
is
heap-based
and
reachable
pre-authentication
on
every
SSL
VPN
appliance
.
In
a
separate
blog
,
Fortinet
mentioned
limited
exploitation
observed
of
this
exploit
yet
,
however
since
detailed
analysis
of
this
vulnerability
is
surfacing
,
Rapid7
is
expecting
exploitation
of
this
vulnerability
to
happen
but
not
on
a
large
mass
scale
.
