Incorrect
access
control
in
Yubico
OTP
functionality
of
the
YubiKey
hardware
tokens
along
with
the
Yubico
OTP
validation
server
.
The
Yubico
OTP
supposedly
creates
hardware
bound
second
factor
credentials
.
When
a
user
reprograms
the
OTP
functionality
by
``
writing
''
it
on
a
token
using
the
Yubico
Personalization
Tool
,
they
can
then
upload
the
new
configuration
to
Yubicos
OTP
validation
servers
.
