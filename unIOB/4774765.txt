The
Rest
API
URLs
are
authenticated
by
a
specific
security
filter
in
ADSelfService
Plus
.
Attackers
used
specially
crafted
Rest
API
URLs
that
were
able
to
bypass
this
security
filter
due
to
an
error
in
normalizing
the
URLs
before
validation
.
This
,
in
turn
,
gave
attackers
access
to
REST
API
endpoints
,
and
they
exploited
the
endpoints
to
perform
subsequent
attacks
such
as
arbitrary
command
execution
.
The
following
exploit
analysis
flowchart
shows
how
the
attackers
exploited
the
vulnerability
.
Zoho
ManageEngine
ADSelfService

version

and
prior
is
vulnerable
to
REST
API
authentication
bypass
with
resultant
remote
code
