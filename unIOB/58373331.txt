The
wordpress
vertical
image
slider
plugin
for
WordPress
is
vulnerable
to
Reflected
Cross-Site
Scripting
via
the
&

;
search_term
&
#

;
parameter
in
versions
up
to
,
and
including
,
1.2.16
due
to
insufficient
input
sanitization
and
output
escaping
.
This
makes
it
possible
for
unauthenticated
attackers
to
inject
arbitrary
web
scripts
in
pages
that
execute
if
they
can
successfully
trick
a
user
into
performing
an
action
such
as
clicking
on
a
link
.
