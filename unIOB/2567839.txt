Cross
Zone
Scripting
An
attacker
is
able
to
cause
a
victim
to
load
content
into
their
web-browser
that
bypasses
security
zone
controls
and
gain
access
to
increased
privileges
to
execute
scripting
code
or
other
web
objects
such
as
unsigned
ActiveX
controls
or
applets
.
This
is
a
privilege
elevation
attack
targeted
at
zone-based
web-browser
security
.
In
a
zone-based
model
,
pages
belong
to
one
of
a
set
of
zones
corresponding
to
the
level
of
privilege
assigned
to
that
page
.
Pages
in
an
untrusted
zone
would
have
a
lesser
level
of
access
to
the
system
and/or
be
restricted
in
the
types
of
executable
content
it
was
allowed
to
invoke
.
In
a
cross-zone
scripting
attack
,
a
page
that
should
be
assigned
to
a
less
privileged
zone
is
granted
the
privileges
of
a
more
trusted
zone
.
This
can
be
accomplished
by
exploiting
bugs
in
the
browser
,
exploiting
incorrect
configuration
in
the
zone
controls
,
through
a
cross-site
scripting
attack
that
causes
the
attackers
'
content
to
be
treated
as
coming
from
a
more
trusted
page
,
or
by
leveraging
some
piece
of
system
functionality
that
is
accessible
from
both
the
trusted
and
less
trusted
zone
.
This
attack
differs
from
``
Restful
Privilege
Escalation
''
in
that
the
latter
correlates
to
the
inadequate
securing
of
RESTful
access
methods
(
such
as
HTTP
DELETE
)
on
the
server
,
while
cross-zone
scripting
attacks
the
concept
of
security
zones
as
implemented
by
a
browser
.
The
target
must
be
using
a
zone-aware
browser
.
Disable
script
execution
.
Ensure
that
sufficient
input
validation
is
performed
for
any
potentially
untrusted
data
before
it
is
used
in
any
privileged
context
or
zone
Limit
the
flow
of
untrusted
data
into
the
privileged
areas
of
the
system
that
run
in
the
higher
trust
zone
Limit
the
sites
that
are
being
added
to
the
local
machine
zone
and
restrict
the
privileges
of
the
code
running
in
that
zone
to
the
bare
minimum
Ensure
proper
HTML
output
encoding
before
writing
user
supplied
data
to
the
page
