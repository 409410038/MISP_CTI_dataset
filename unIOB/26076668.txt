LockBit
2.0
operates
as
an
affiliate-based
Ransomware-as-a-Service
(
RaaS
)
and
employs
a
wide
variety
of
tactics
,
techniques
,
and
procedures
(
TTPs
)
,
creating
significant
challenges
for
defense
and
mitigation
.
LockBit
2.0
ransomware
compromises
victim
networks
through
a
variety
of
techniques
,
including
,
but
not
limited
to
,
purchased
access
,
unpatched
vulnerabilities
,
insider
access
,
and
zero
day
exploits
.
After
compromising
a
victim
network
,
LockBit
2.0
actors
use
publicly
available
tools
such
as
Mimikatz
to
escalate
privileges
.
The
threat
actors
then
use
both
publicly
available
and
custom
tools
to
exfiltrate
data
followed
by
encryption
using
the
Lockbit
malware
.
The
actors
always
leave
a
ransom
note
in
each
affected
directory
within
victim
systems
,
which
provides
instructions
on
how
to
obtain
the
decryption
software
.
The
ransom
note
also
threatens
to
leak
exfiltrated
victim
data
on
the
LockBit
2.0
leak
site
and
demands
a
ransom
to
avoid
these
actions
.
In
July
2021
,
LockBit
2.0
released
an
update
which
featured
the
automatic
encryption
of
devices
across
windows
domains
by
abusing
Active
Directory
group
policies
.
In
August
2021
,
LockBit
2.0
began
to
advertise
for
insiders
to
establish
initial
access
into
potential
victim
networks
,
while
promising
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
from
a
successful
attack
.
LockBit
2.0
also
developed
a
Linux-based
malware
which
takes
advantage
of
vulnerabilities
within
VMWare
ESXi
virtual
machines
.
