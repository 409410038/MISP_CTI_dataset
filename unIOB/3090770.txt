SEKOIA
observed
that
PrivateLoader
is
one
of
the
most
widely
used
loaders
in
2022
.
It
is
used
by
a
Pay-Per-Install
service
to
deploy
multiple
malicious
payloads
on
the
infected
hosts
.
First
observed
in
May
2021
,
PrivateLoader
is
a
modular
malware
whose
main
capability
is
to
download
and
execute
one
or
several
payloads
.
The
loader
implements
anti-analysis
techniques
,
fingerprints
the
compromised
host
and
reports
statistics
to
its
C2
server
.
SEKOIA
analysts
tracked
PrivateLoader
’
s
network
infrastructure
for
several
months
and
recently
conducted
an
in-depth
analysis
of
the
malware
.
In
parallel
,
we
also
monitored
activities
related
to
the
ruzki
PPI
malware
service
.
The
threat
actor
ruzki
(
aka
les0k
,
zhigalsz
)
advertises
their
PPI
service
on
underground
Russian-speaking
forums
and
their
Telegram
channels
under
the
name
ruzki
or
zhigalsz
since
at
least
May
2021
.
Their
business
model
consists
in
selling
bundles
of
thousand
installations
,
located
on
systems
all
over
the
world
,
or
specifically
in
Europe
or
in
the
United
States
.
Our
investigations
on
Dark
Web
forums
allow
us
to
assess
with
high
confidence
that
PrivateLoader
is
the
proprietary
loader
of
the
ruzki
PPI
malware
service
.
