Accessing/Intercepting/Modifying
HTTP
Cookies
.
This
attack
relies
on
the
use
of
HTTP
Cookies
to
store
credentials
,
state
information
and
other
critical
data
on
client
systems
.
There
are
several
different
forms
of
this
attack
.
The
first
form
of
this
attack
involves
accessing
HTTP
Cookies
to
mine
for
potentially
sensitive
data
contained
therein
.
The
second
form
involves
intercepting
this
data
as
it
is
transmitted
from
client
to
server
.
This
intercepted
information
is
then
used
by
the
adversary
to
impersonate
the
remote
user/session
.
The
third
form
is
when
the
cookie
's
content
is
modified
by
the
adversary
before
it
is
sent
back
to
the
server
.
Here
the
adversary
seeks
to
convince
the
target
server
to
operate
on
this
falsified
information
.
Target
server
software
must
be
a
HTTP
daemon
that
relies
on
cookies
.
The
cookies
must
contain
sensitive
information
.
The
adversary
must
be
able
to
make
HTTP
requests
to
the
server
,
and
the
cookie
must
be
contained
in
the
reply
.
Design
:
Use
input
validation
for
cookies
Design
:
Generate
and
validate
MAC
for
cookies
Implementation
:
Use
SSL/TLS
to
protect
cookie
in
transit
Implementation
:
Ensure
the
web
server
implements
all
relevant
security
patches
,
many
exploitable
buffer
overflows
are
fixed
in
patches
issued
for
the
software
.
