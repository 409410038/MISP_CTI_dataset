These
IOCs
come
from
an
ESET
blog
post
regarding
an
updated
version
of
the
ArguePatch
malware
loader
that
was
used
in
the
Industroyer2
attack
against
a
Ukrainian
energy
provider
and
in
multiple
attacks
involving
data
wiping
malware
called
CaddyWiper
.
The
new
variant
of
ArguePatch
now
includes
a
feature
to
execute
the
next
stage
of
an
attack
at
a
specified
time
.
This
bypasses
the
need
for
setting
up
a
scheduled
task
in
Windows
and
is
likely
intended
to
help
the
attackers
stay
under
the
radar
.
Another
difference
between
the
two
otherwise
highly
similar
variants
is
that
the
new
iteration
uses
an
official
ESET
executable
to
hide
ArguePatch
,
with
the
digital
signature
removed
and
code
overwritten
.
