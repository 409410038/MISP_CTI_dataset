Subverting
Environment
Variable
Values
.
The
attacker
directly
or
indirectly
modifies
environment
variables
used
by
or
controlling
the
target
software
.
The
attacker's
goal
is
to
cause
the
target
software
to
deviate
from
its
expected
operation
in
a
manner
that
benefits
the
attacker
.
An
environment
variable
is
accessible
to
the
user
.
An
environment
variable
used
by
the
application
can
be
tainted
with
user
supplied
data
.
Input
data
used
in
an
environment
variable
is
not
validated
properly
.
The
variables
encapsulation
is
not
done
properly
.
For
instance
setting
a
variable
as
public
in
a
class
makes
it
visible
and
an
attacker
may
attempt
to
manipulate
that
variable
.
Protect
environment
variables
against
unauthorized
read
and
write
access
.
Protect
the
configuration
files
which
contain
environment
variables
against
illegitimate
read
and
write
access
.
Assume
all
input
is
malicious
.
Create
a
white
list
that
defines
all
valid
input
to
the
software
system
based
on
the
requirements
specifications
.
Input
that
does
not
match
against
the
white
list
should
not
be
permitted
to
enter
into
the
system
.
Apply
the
least
privilege
principles
.
If
a
process
has
no
legitimate
reason
to
read
an
environment
variable
do
not
give
that
privilege
.
