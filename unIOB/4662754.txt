While
the
official
conflict
between
Russia
and
Ukraine
began
in
February
2022
,
there
is
a
long
history
of
physical
conflict
between
the
two
nations
,
including
the
2014
annexation
of
Crimea
by
Russia
and
when
the
regions
of
Donetsk
and
Luhansk
declared
themselves
independent
from
Ukraine
and
came
under
Russia
's
umbrella
.
Given
this
context
,
it
would
not
be
surprising
that
the
cybersecurity
landscape
between
these
two
countries
has
also
been
tense
.
While
looking
for
activities
from
the
usual
suspects
,
one
of
our
former
coworkers
at
Malwarebytes
Threat
Intelligence
Team
discovered
a
new
interesting
lure
that
targeted
the
Eastern
Ukraine
region
and
reported
that
finding
to
the
public
.
Moreover
,
we
started
tracking
the
actor
behind
it
,
which
we
internally
codenamed
Red
Stinger
.
This
investigation
remained
private
for
a
while
,
but
Kaspersky
recently
published
information
about
the
same
actor
(
who
it
called
Bad
Magic
)
.
Now
that
the
existence
of
this
group
is
public
,
we
will
also
share
some
of
our
information
about
the
actor
and
its
tactics
.
