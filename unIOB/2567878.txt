Utilizing
REST's
Trust
in
the
System
Resource
to
Obtain
Sensitive
Data
This
attack
utilizes
a
REST
(
REpresentational
State
Transfer
)
-style
applications
'
trust
in
the
system
resources
and
environment
to
obtain
sensitive
data
once
SSL
is
terminated
.
Rest
applications
premise
is
that
they
leverage
existing
infrastructure
to
deliver
web
services
functionality
.
An
example
of
this
is
a
Rest
application
that
uses
HTTP
Get
methods
and
receives
a
HTTP
response
with
an
XML
document
.
These
Rest
style
web
services
are
deployed
on
existing
infrastructure
such
as
Apache
and
IIS
web
servers
with
no
SOAP
stack
required
.
Unfortunately
from
a
security
standpoint
,
there
frequently
is
no
interoperable
identity
security
mechanism
deployed
,
so
Rest
developers
often
fall
back
to
SSL
to
deliver
security
.
In
large
data
centers
,
SSL
is
typically
terminated
at
the
edge
of
the
network
-
at
the
firewall
,
load
balancer
,
or
router
.
Once
the
SSL
is
terminated
the
HTTP
request
is
in
the
clear
(
unless
developers
have
hashed
or
encrypted
the
values
,
but
this
is
rare
)
.
The
attacker
can
utilize
a
sniffer
such
as
Wireshark
to
snapshot
the
credentials
,
such
as
username
and
password
that
are
passed
in
the
clear
once
SSL
is
terminated
.
Once
the
attacker
gathers
these
credentials
,
they
can
submit
requests
to
the
web
service
provider
just
as
authorized
user
do
.
There
is
not
typically
an
authentication
on
the
client
side
,
beyond
what
is
passed
in
the
request
itself
so
once
this
is
compromised
,
then
this
is
generally
sufficient
to
compromise
the
service
's
authentication
scheme
.
Opportunity
to
intercept
must
exist
beyond
the
point
where
SSL
is
terminated
.
The
attacker
must
be
able
to
insert
a
listener
actively
(
proxying
the
communication
)
or
passively
(
sniffing
the
communication
)
in
the
client-server
communication
path
.
Implementation
:
Implement
message
level
security
such
as
HMAC
in
the
HTTP
communication
Design
:
Utilize
defense
in
depth
,
do
not
rely
on
a
single
security
mechanism
like
SSL
Design
:
Enforce
principle
of
least
privilege
