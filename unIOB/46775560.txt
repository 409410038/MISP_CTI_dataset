All
of
the
IP
addresses
used
to
connect
to
the
compromised
accounts
were
from
the
Express
VPN
(
Virtual
Private
Network
)
service
.
Nevertheless
,
Human
Rights
Watch
found
one
Iranian
IP
address
,
5.160.239.XXX
,
that
connected
to
one
of
the
target
’
s
inboxes
.
This
could
potentially
be
the
public
IP
address
of
the
attacker
’
s
own
network
,
perhaps
revealed
after
they
forgot
to
enable
their
VPN
before
connecting
.
