In
Q1
of
2023
,
SentinelLabs
observed
initial
phases
of
attacks
against
telecommunication
providers
in
the
Middle
East
.
We
assess
that
this
activity
represents
an
evolution
of
tooling
associated
with
Operation
Soft
Cell
.
While
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
threat
actor
is
a
Chinese
cyberespionage
group
in
the
nexus
of
Gallium
and
APT41
,
the
exact
grouping
remains
unclear
.
SentinelLabs
observed
the
use
of
a
well-maintained
,
versioned
credential
theft
capability
and
a
new
dropper
mechanism
indicative
of
an
ongoing
development
effort
by
a
highly-motivated
threat
actor
with
specific
tasking
requirements
.
