The
Lazarus
group
is
a
high-profile
Korean-speaking
threat
actor
with
multiple
sub-campaigns
.
We
have
previously
published
information
about
the
connections
of
each
cluster
of
this
group
.
In
this
blog
,
we
â€™
ll
focus
on
an
active
cluster
that
we
dubbed
DeathNote
because
the
malware
responsible
for
downloading
additional
payloads
is
named
Dn.dll
or
Dn64.dll
.
This
threat
is
also
known
as
Operation
DreamJob
or
NukeSped
.
Over
the
past
few
years
,
we
have
closely
monitored
the
DeathNote
cluster
,
observing
a
shift
in
their
targets
as
well
as
the
development
and
refinement
of
their
tools
,
techniques
,
and
procedures
.
