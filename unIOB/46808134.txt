suffers
from
insufficient
session
expiration
when
an
administrator
performs
a
security
relevant
edit
on
an
existing
,
logged
on
user
.
For
example
,
if
a
user
's
password
is
changed
by
an
administrator
due
to
an
otherwise
unrelated
credential
leak
,
that
user
account
's
current
session
is
still
valid
after
the
password
change
,
potentially
allowing
the
attacker
who
originally
compromised
the
credential
to
remain
logged
in
and
able
to
cause
further
damage
.
This
vulnerability
is
mitigated
by
the
use
of
the
Platform
Login
feature
.
This
issue
is
related
to
CVE-2019-5638
.
