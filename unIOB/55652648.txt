Weblate
is
a
web
based
localization
tool
with
tight
version
control
integration
.
Prior
to
version
4.11.1
,
Weblate
did
n't
properly
sanitize
some
arguments
passed
to
Git
and
Mercurial
,
allowing
them
to
change
their
behavior
in
an
unintended
way
.
Instances
where
untrusted
users
can
not
create
new
components
are
not
affected
.
The
issues
were
fixed
in
the
4.11.1
release
.
