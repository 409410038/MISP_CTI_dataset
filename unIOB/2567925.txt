Leverage
Alternate
Encoding
.
An
adversary
leverages
the
possibility
to
encode
potentially
harmful
input
or
content
used
by
applications
such
that
the
applications
are
ineffective
at
validating
this
encoding
standard
.
The
application's
decoder
accepts
and
interprets
encoded
characters
.
Data
canonicalization
,
input
filtering
and
validating
is
not
done
properly
leaving
the
door
open
to
harmful
characters
for
the
target
host
.
Assume
all
input
might
use
an
improper
representation
.
Use
canonicalized
data
inside
the
application
;
all
data
must
be
converted
into
the
representation
used
inside
the
application
(
UTF-8
,
UTF-16
,
etc
.
)
Assume
all
input
is
malicious
.
Create
a
white
list
that
defines
all
valid
input
to
the
software
system
based
on
the
requirements
specifications
.
Input
that
does
not
match
against
the
white
list
should
not
be
permitted
to
enter
into
the
system
.
Test
your
decoding
process
against
malicious
input
.
