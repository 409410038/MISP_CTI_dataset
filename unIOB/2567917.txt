In
this
attack
pattern
,
the
adversary
leverages
fuzzing
to
try
to
identify
weaknesses
in
the
system
.
Fuzzing
is
a
software
security
and
functionality
testing
method
that
feeds
randomly
constructed
input
to
the
system
and
looks
for
an
indication
that
a
failure
in
response
to
that
input
has
occurred
.
Fuzzing
treats
the
system
as
a
black
box
and
is
totally
free
from
any
preconceptions
or
assumptions
about
the
system
.
Fuzzing
can
help
an
attacker
discover
certain
assumptions
made
about
user
input
in
the
system
.
Fuzzing
gives
an
attacker
a
quick
way
of
potentially
uncovering
some
of
these
assumptions
despite
not
necessarily
knowing
anything
about
the
internals
of
the
system
.
These
assumptions
can
then
be
turned
against
the
system
by
specially
crafting
user
input
that
may
allow
an
attacker
to
achieve
his
goals
.
Test
to
ensure
that
the
software
behaves
as
per
specification
and
that
there
are
no
unintended
side
effects
.
Ensure
that
no
assumptions
about
the
validity
of
data
are
made
.
Use
fuzz
testing
during
the
software
QA
process
to
uncover
any
surprises
,
uncover
any
assumptions
or
unexpected
behavior
.
