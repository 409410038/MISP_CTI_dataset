AMD
microprocessor
families
15h
to
18h
are
affected
by
a
new
Spectre
variant
that
is
able
to
bypass
their
retpoline
mitigation
in
the
kernel
to
leak
arbitrary
data
.
An
attacker
with
unprivileged
user
access
can
hijack
return
instructions
to
achieve
arbitrary
speculative
code
execution
under
certain
microarchitecture-dependent
conditions
.
