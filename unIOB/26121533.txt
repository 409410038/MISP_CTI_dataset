The
phishing
emails
take
many
approaches
to
gain
the
appearance
of
legitimacy
.
This
includes
fake
body
content
with
a
forwarding
history
containing
long
lists
of
recipients
,
original
email
recipient
lists
with
many
seemingly
fake
accounts
,
or
simply
resending
their
malware
multiple
times
using
new
emails
or
lure
documents
.
Notably
,
in
specific
attacks
,
the
actor
would
be
particularly
persistent
and
attempt
to
compromise
the
same
individuals
multiple
times
in
a
single
day
.
