They
tended
to
only
use
a
single
domain
per
IP
address
and
domains
were
very
rarely
reused
across
multiple
IP
addresses
.
Many
of
the
observed
domains
were
deployed
using
free
Let

s
Encrypt
SSL
certificates
,
while
others
used
self-signed
certificates
designed
to
blend
in
with
normal
Kubernetes
deployments
.
