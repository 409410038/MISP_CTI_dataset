Embedding
NULL
Bytes
An
attacker
embeds
one
or
more
null
bytes
in
input
to
the
target
software
.
This
attack
relies
on
the
usage
of
a
null-valued
byte
as
a
string
terminator
in
many
environments
.
The
goal
is
for
certain
components
of
the
target
software
to
stop
processing
the
input
when
it
encounters
the
null
byte
(
s
)
.
The
program
does
not
properly
handle
postfix
NULL
terminators
Properly
handle
the
NULL
characters
supplied
as
part
of
user
input
prior
to
doing
anything
with
the
data
.
