The
application
,
after
a
successful
login
,
sets
the
session
cookie
on
the
browser
via
client-side
JavaScript
code
,
without
applying
any
security
attributes
(
such
as
&
#

;
Secure
&
#
8221
;
,
&
#
8220
;
HttpOnly
&
#
8221
;
,
or

;
SameSite
&
#

;
)
.
Any
attempts
to
browse
the
application
via
unencrypted
HTTP
protocol
would
lead

the
transmission
of
all
his/her
session
cookies
in
plaintext
through
the
network
.
An
attacker
could
then
be
able
to
sniff
the
network
and
capture
sensitive
information
.
