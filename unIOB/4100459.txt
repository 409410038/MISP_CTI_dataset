QUARTERRIG
is
a
dropper
that
was
used
in
an
espionage
campaign
significantly
overlapping
with
publicly
described
activity
linked
to
the
APT29
and
NOBELIUM
activity
sets
.
QUARTERRIG
does
not
contain
any
other
capabilities
aside
from
downloading
and
executing
2nd
stage
.
To
bypass
security
products
,
QUARTERRIG
heavily
relies
on
obfuscation
based
on
opaque
predicates
and
multi-stage
execution
,
interweaving
shellcode
and
PE
files
.
HALFRIG
and
QUARTERRIG
share
some
of
the
codebase
,
suggesting
that
QUARTERRIG
authors
have
access
to
both
HALFRIG
source
code
and
the
same
obfuscation
libraries
.
