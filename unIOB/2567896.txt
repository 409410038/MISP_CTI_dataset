Blind
SQL
Injection
Blind
SQL
Injection
results
from
an
insufficient
mitigation
for
SQL
Injection
.
Although
suppressing
database
error
messages
are
considered
best
practice
,
the
suppression
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
prevent
SQL
Injection
.
Blind
SQL
Injection
is
a
form
of
SQL
Injection
that
overcomes
the
lack
of
error
messages
.
Without
the
error
messages
that
facilitate
SQL
Injection
,
the
adversary
constructs
input
strings
that
probe
the
target
through
simple
Boolean
SQL
expressions
.
The
adversary
can
determine
if
the
syntax
and
structure
of
the
injection
was
successful
based
on
whether
the
query
was
executed
or
not
.
Applied
iteratively
,
the
adversary
determines
how
and
where
the
target
is
vulnerable
to
SQL
Injection
.
SQL
queries
used
by
the
application
to
store
,
retrieve
or
modify
data
.
User-controllable
input
that
is
not
properly
validated
by
the
application
as
part
of
SQL
queries
.
Security
by
Obscurity
is
not
a
solution
to
preventing
SQL
Injection
.
Rather
than
suppress
error
messages
and
exceptions
,
the
application
must
handle
them
gracefully
,
returning
either
a
custom
error
page
or
redirecting
the
user
to
a
default
page
,
without
revealing
any
information
about
the
database
or
the
application
internals
.
Strong
input
validation
-
All
user-controllable
input
must
be
validated
and
filtered
for
illegal
characters
as
well
as
SQL
content
.
Keywords
such
as
UNION
,
SELECT
or
INSERT
must
be
filtered
in
addition
to
characters
such
as
a
single-quote
(
'
)
or
SQL-comments
(
--
)
based
on
the
context
in
which
they
appear
.
