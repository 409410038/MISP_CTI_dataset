Accessing
Functionality
Not
Properly
Constrained
by
ACLs
In
applications
,
particularly
web
applications
,
access
to
functionality
is
mitigated
by
an
authorization
framework
.
This
framework
maps
Access
Control
Lists
(
ACLs
)
to
elements
of
the
application
's
functionality
;
particularly
URL
's
for
web
apps
.
In
the
case
that
the
administrator
failed
to
specify
an
ACL
for
a
particular
element
,
an
attacker
may
be
able
to
access
it
with
impunity
.
An
attacker
with
the
ability
to
access
functionality
not
properly
constrained
by
ACLs
can
obtain
sensitive
information
and
possibly
compromise
the
entire
application
.
Such
an
attacker
can
access
resources
that
must
be
available
only
to
users
at
a
higher
privilege
level
,
can
access
management
sections
of
the
application
,
or
can
run
queries
for
data
that
they
otherwise
not
supposed
to
.
The
application
must
be
navigable
in
a
manner
that
associates
elements
(
subsections
)
of
the
application
with
ACLs
.
The
various
resources
,
or
individual
URLs
,
must
be
somehow
discoverable
by
the
attacker
The
administrator
must
have
forgotten
to
associate
an
ACL
or
has
associated
an
inappropriately
permissive
ACL
with
a
particular
navigable
resource
.
In
a
more
general
setting
,
the
administrator
must
mark
every
resource
besides
the
ones
supposed
to
be
exposed
to
the
user
as
accessible
by
a
role
impossible
for
the
user
to
assume
.
The
default
security
setting
must
be
to
deny
access
and
then
grant
access
only
to
those
resources
intended
by
business
logic
.
