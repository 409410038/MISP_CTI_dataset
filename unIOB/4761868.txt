Executive
Summary
SentinelLabs
identified
10
ransomware
families
using
VMware
ESXi
lockers
based
on
the
2021
Babuk
source
code
leaks
.
These
variants
emerged
through
H2
2022
and
H1
2023
,
which
shows
an
increasing
trend
of
Babuk
source
code
adoption
.
Leaked
source
code
enables
actors
to
target
Linux
systems
when
they
may
otherwise
lack
expertise
to
build
a
working
program
.
Source
code
leaks
further
complicate
attribution
,
as
more
actors
will
adopt
the
tools
.
