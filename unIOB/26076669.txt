LockBit
2.0
is
best
described
as
a
heavily
obfuscated
ransomware
application
leveraging
bitwise
operations
to
decode
strings
and
load
required
modules
to
evade
detection
.
Upon
launch
,
LockBit
2.0
decodes
the
necessary
strings
and
code
to
import
the
required
modules
followed
by
determining
if
the
process
has
administrative
privileges
.
If
privileges
are
not
sufficient
,
it
attempts
to
escalate
to
the
required
privileges
.
Lockbit
2.0
then
determines
the
system
and
user
language
settings
and
only
targets
those
not
matching
a
set
list
of
languages
that
are
Eastern
European
.
If
an
Eastern
European
language
is
detected
,
the
program
exits
without
infection
.
As
infection
begins
,
Lockbit
2.0
deletes
log
files
and
shadow
copies
residing
on
disk
.
Lockbit
2.0
enumerates
system
information
to
include
hostname
,
host
configuration
,
domain
information
,
local
drive
configuration
,
remote
shares
,
and
mounted
external
storage
devices
.
Lockbit
2.0
attempts
to
encrypt
any
data
saved
to
any
local
or
remote
device
but
skips
files
associated
with
core
system
functions
.
Once
completed
,
Lockbit
2.0
deletes
itself
from
disk
and
creates
persistence
at
startup
.
Prior
to
encryption
,
Lockbit
affiliates
primarily
use
the
Stealbit
application
obtained
directly
from
the
Lockbit
panel
to
exfiltrate
specific
file
types
.
The
desired
file
types
can
be
configured
by
the
affiliate
to
tailor
the
attack
to
the
victim
.
The
affiliate
configures
the
application
to
target
a
desired
file
path
and
,
upon
execution
,
the
tool
copies
the
files
to
an
attacker-controlled
server
using
http
.
Due
to
the
nature
of
the
affiliate
model
,
some
attackers
use
other
commercially
available
tools
such
as
rclone
and
MEGAsync
to
achieve
the
same
results
.
Lockbit
2.0
actors
often
use
publicly
available
file
sharing
services
including
,
privatlab
[
.
]
net
,
anonfiles
[
.
]
com
,
sendspace

,
fex
[
.
]
net
,
transfer
[
.
]
sh
,
and
send.exploit
[
.
]
in
.
While
some
of
these
applications
and
services
can
support
legitimate
purposes
,
they
can
also
be
used
by
threat
actors
to
aid
in
system
compromise
or
exploration
of
an
enterprise
.
