researchers
collected
and
analyzed
a
lure
document
used
to
implant
a
variant
of
Graphite
malware
,
uniquely
linked
to
the
threat
actor
known
as
APT28
(
aka
Fancy
Bear
,
TSAR
Team
)
.
This
is
a
threat
group
attributed
to
Russia
â€™
s
Main
Intelligence
Directorate
of
the
Russian
General
Staff
by
a
July
2018
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
indictment
.
The
lure
document
is
a
PowerPoint
file
that
exploits
a
code
execution
technique
,
which
is
designed
to
be
triggered
when
the
user
starts
the
presentation
mode
and
moves
the
mouse
.
The
code
execution
runs
a
PowerShell
script
that
downloads
and
executes
a
dropper
from
OneDrive
.
The
latter
downloads
a
payload
that
extracts
and
injects
in
itself
a
new
PE
(
Portable
Executable
)
file
,
that
the
analysis
showed
to
be
a
variant
of
a
malware
family
known
as
Graphite
,
that
uses
the
Microsoft
Graph
API
and
OneDrive
for
C
&
C
communications
.
