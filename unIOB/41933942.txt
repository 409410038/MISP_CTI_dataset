A
flaw
was
found
in
Wordpress
5.1
.
``
X-Forwarded-For
''
is
a
HTTP
header
used
to
carry
the
client
's
original
IP
address
.
However
,
because
these
headers
may
very
well
be
added
by
the
client
to
the
requests
,
if
the
systems/devices
use
IP
addresses
which
decelerate
at
X-Forwarded-For
header
instead
of
original
IP
,
various
issues
may
be
faced
.
If
the
data
originating
from
these
fields
is
trusted
by
the
application
developers
and
processed
,
any
authorization
checks
originating
IP
address
logging
could
be
manipulated
.
