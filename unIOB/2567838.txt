This
type
of
attack
against
older
telephone
switches
and
trunks
has
been
around
for
decades
.
A
tone
is
sent
by
an
adversary
to
impersonate
a
supervisor
signal
which
has
the
effect
of
rerouting
or
usurping
command
of
the
line
.
While
the
US
infrastructure
proper
may
not
contain
widespread
vulnerabilities
to
this
type
of
attack
,
many
companies
are
connected
globally
through
call
centers
and
business
process
outsourcing
.
These
international
systems
may
be
operated
in
countries
which
have
not
upgraded
Telco
infrastructure
and
so
are
vulnerable
to
Blue
boxing
.
Blue
boxing
is
a
result
of
failure
on
the
part
of
the
system
to
enforce
strong
authorization
for
administrative
functions
.
While
the
infrastructure
is
different
than
standard
current
applications
like
web
applications
,
there
are
historical
lessons
to
be
learned
to
upgrade
the
access
control
for
administrative
functions
.
System
must
use
weak
authentication
mechanisms
for
administrative
functions
.
Implementation
:
Upgrade
phone
lines
.
Note
this
may
be
prohibitively
expensive
Use
strong
access
control
such
as
two
factor
access
control
for
administrative
access
to
the
switch
