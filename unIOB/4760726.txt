Executive
Summary
The
Executive
Summary
section
of
this
report
offers
a
non-technical
outline
of
the
Paperbug
Campaign
,
its
targets
,
and
its
organizational
structure
.
3.1
Overview
According
to
unearthed
victim
data
,
Tajikistan
is
the
ultimate
target
of
this
operation
.
The
target
list
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
Tajikistan
’
s
government
officials
,
public
service
infrastructures
and
the
telecom
provider
.
The
initial
step
that
led
to
the
compromising
of
other
victims
very
likely
was
the
infiltration
of
the
network
,
even
though
the
initial
access
time
to
and
how
it
was
infiltrated
is
uncertain
.
This
is
also
supported
by
the
order
of
victim
contributions
to
the
operation
panel
;
the
group
has
gained
access
telecommunication
firm
network
and
its
employees
firstly
.
This
then
led
to
the
group
carrying
out
lateral
movement
on
at
least
18
ultimate
targets
(
deleted
victims
are
not
counted
)
,
largely
focusing
on
government
networks
,
executives
’
and
OT
devices
with
publicly
known
vulnerabilities
,
while
also
performing
deep
reconnaissance
of
networks
,
customers
,
and
affiliates
.
According
to
the
frequency
of
screenshots
being
taken
by
Nomadic
Octopus
especially
while
targeted
victims
were
writing
e-mails
and
creating
new
contracts
of
their
customers
,
the
group
spied
on
devices
and
took
their
notes
diligently
.
Operation
PaperBug
aligns
with
the
common
trend
of
attacking
into
central
asia
government
infrastructure
that
recently
became
more
prominent
.
This
trend
can
also
be
seen
in
other
Russian
speaking
state-sponsored
threat
actors
like
Sofacy
[

]
.
They
have
also
been
observed
attacking
telecommunication
infrastructure
in
central
asian
regions
,
including
Tajikistan
.
This
indicates
that
there
might
be
some
ties
between
the
main
subject
of
this
report
Nomadic
Octopus
and
other
prominent
espionage
groups
like
Sofacy
.
3.2
Characteristics
of
the
Paperbug
Operation
Politically-Motivated
Surveillance
:
According
to
PTI
Team
’
s
analysis
of
Nomadic
Octopus
’
behavior
,
they
tend
to
infiltrate
wherever
the
group
can
access
to
without
much
discrimination
.
However
,
they
then
go
through
the
acquired
devices
and
only
keep
the
victims
that
are
valuable
in
terms
of
surveillance
and
political
gains
.
The
group
tends
to
remove
their
access
if
the
victim
is
not
related
with
public
services
or
government
infrastructures
.
Also
,
it
is
observed
that
operators
steal
e-mails
,
documents
in
compromised
devices
and
instant
messaging
apps
’
chat
history
periodically
to
leak
potentially
sensitive
information
.
Targets
Central
Asia
Government
Officials
:
According
to
the
PTI
Team
’
s
victim
analysis
,
most
Paperbug
victims
have
governmental
connections
.
A
few
of
the
individuals
that
were
compromised
were
successfully
identified
by
the
PTI
team
,
and
it
was
confirmed
that
they
are
government
officials
in
Central
Asia
.
Moreover
,
the
group
writes
notes
about
the
compromised
devices
and
their
possible
owners
,
the
notes
appear
to
be
in
Russian
.
These
notes
,
alongside
more
information
,
can
be
found
in
Figure
23
.
Targets
Telecom
Companies
:
The
aspect
setting
this
operation
apart
from
other
operation
conducted
in
Central
Asia
is
the
method
it
uses
to
compromise
its
victims
.
The
starting
point
of
this
operation
is
the
compromisation
of
the
networks
of
a
Tajikistan
based
telecom
company
,
.
The
first
victim
machine
on
the
C
&
C
server
was
also
a
device
in
the
network
.
This
idea
is
also
supported
by
the
domain
name
used
for
the
operation
:
.
.
Moreover
,
most
of
the
compromised
IPs
are
from
the
IP
block
.
Unfortunately
,
the
point
of
initial
access
to
the
network
is
unclear
.
It
is
determined
that
Paperbug
operation
started
in
this
firm
’
s
network
then
expanded
their
access
through
document
theft
,
stolen
clients
’
contracts
and
credentials
,
weak
network
security
configurations
and
exploitation
of
not
up-to-date
software
and
services
.
Targets
OT
Devices
:
OT
device
connections
are
also
kept
by
the
Nomadic
Octopus
team
.
When
a
team
member
analyzes
a
compromised
machine
and
decides
on
its
value
,
they
categorize
the
machine
as
one
of
the
types
of
victims
that
they
are
interested
in
.
If
it
does
not
fit
into
any
of
the
categories
,
the
machine
is
then
removed
from
the
system
.
The
PTI
Team
has
observed
that
even
though
they
are
placed
under
a
more
generic
category
,
the
Nomadic
Octopus
operators
chose
to
keep
the
victims
used
for
operational
technology
.
Not
Stealthy
on
Victim
Devices
:
Despite
the
high
stakes
of
the
operation
and
the
levels
of
government
that
the
group
is
dealing
with
,
there
have
been
several
cases
where
the
operators
failed
to
stay
stealthy
in
the
compromised
systems
.
As
they
operate
on
the
compromised
machines
to
steal
information
,
they
sometimes
inadvertently
caused
permission
pop-ups
on
victim
computers
,
which
resulted
in
suspicion
from
the
victim
.
However
,
this
was
resolved
due
to
the
group
diligently
naming
the
files
they
transfer
as
benign
and
inconspicuous
programs
.
Connections
to
other
campaigns
targeting
Central
Asia
:
Even
though
this
report
covers
on
only
two
domains
used
for
running
the
operation
.
The
PTI
Team
has
also
observed
other
domains
that
are
likely
to
be
related
.
This
indicates
there
is
possibly
more
to
this
campaign
.
Moreover
,
the
increase
in
attacks
to
the
Central
Asia
by
state
sponsored
Russian-speaking
threat
actors
[
8
]
combined
with
the
espionage
nature
of
this
case
as
well
as
the
highly
organized
behavior
of
the
Nomadic
Octopus
operators
indicate
the
group
’
s
possible
connections
to
other
state
sponsored
threat
actors
.
