An
attacker
generates
a
message
or
datablock
that
causes
the
recipient
to
believe
that
the
message
or
datablock
was
generated
and
cryptographically
signed
by
an
authoritative
or
reputable
source
,
misleading
a
victim
or
victim
operating
system
into
performing
malicious
actions
.
The
victim
or
victim
system
is
dependent
upon
a
cryptographic
signature-based
verification
system
for
validation
of
one
or
more
security
events
or
actions
.
The
validation
can
be
bypassed
via
an
attacker-provided
signature
that
makes
it
appear
that
the
legitimate
authoritative
or
reputable
source
provided
the
signature
.
