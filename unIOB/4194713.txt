In
early
April
,
we
detected
a
significant
increase
in
attacks
that
use
banking
Trojans
of
the
QBot
family
(
aka
QakBot
,
QuackBot
,
and
Pinkslipbot
)
.
The
malware
would
be
delivered
through
e-mail
letters
written
in
different
languages
—
variations
of
them
were
coming
in
English
,
German
,
Italian
,
and
French
.
The
messages
were
based
on
real
business
letters
the
attackers
had
gotten
access
to
,
which
afforded
them
the
opportunity
to
join
the
correspondence
thread
with
messages
of
their
own
.
As
a
general
rule
,
such
letters
would
be
urging
the
addressee
—
under
a
plausible
pretext
—
to
open
an
enclosed
PDF
file
.
As
an
example
,
they
could
be
asking
to
provide
all
the
documentation
pertaining
to
the
attached
application
or
to
calculate
the
contract
value
based
on
the
attached
cost
estimate
.
