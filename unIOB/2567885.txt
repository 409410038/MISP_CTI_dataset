Exploiting
Trust
in
Client
.
An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
vulnerabilities
in
client/server
communication
channel
authentication
and
data
integrity
.
It
leverages
the
implicit
trust
a
server
places
in
the
client
,
or
more
importantly
,
that
which
the
server
believes
is
the
client
.
An
attacker
executes
this
type
of
attack
by
communicating
directly
with
the
server
where
the
server
believes
it
is
communicating
only
with
a
valid
client
.
There
are
numerous
variations
of
this
type
of
attack
.
Server
software
must
rely
on
client
side
formatted
and
validated
values
,
and
not
reinforce
these
checks
on
the
server
side
.
Design
:
Ensure
that
client
process
and/or
message
is
authenticated
so
that
anonymous
communications
and/or
messages
are
not
accepted
by
the
system
.
Design
:
Do
not
rely
on
client
validation
or
encoding
for
security
purposes
.
Design
:
Utilize
digital
signatures
to
increase
authentication
assurance
.
Design
:
Utilize
two
factor
authentication
to
increase
authentication
assurance
.
Implementation
:
Perform
input
validation
for
all
remote
content
.
