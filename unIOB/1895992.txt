ESET
researchers
have
uncovered
recent
campaigns
and
an
updated
threat
arsenal
of
the
infamous
APT
group
Donot
Team
(
also
known
as
APT-C-35
and
SectorE02
)
.
According
to
research
findings
,
the
group
is
very
persistent
and
has
consistently
targeted
the
same
organizations
for
at
least
the
last
two
years
.
For
this
research
,
ESET
monitored
Donot
Team
for
more
than
a
year
from
September
2020
to
October
2021
.
According
to
ESET
telemetry
,
the
APT
group
focuses
on
a
small
number
of
targets
primarily
in
South
Asia
—
Bangladesh
,
Sri
Lanka
,
Pakistan
and
Nepal
.
However
,
targeting
embassies
of
these
countries
in
other
regions
,
such
as
the
Middle
East
,
Europe
,
North
America
,
and
Latin
America
,
is
not
outside

’
s
realm
.
These
attacks
are
focused
on
government
and
military
organizations
,
Ministries
of
Foreign
Affairs
,
and
embassies
and
are
motivated
by
cyberespionage
.
