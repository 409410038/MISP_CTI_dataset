Microsoft
announced
at
the
beginning
of
2022
that
they
would
soon
start
to
disable
macros
by
default
in
Office
documents
downloaded
from
the
Internet
.
They
implemented
the
changes
around
June
,
only
to
remove
the
feature
later
that
month
.
The
feature
was
finally
re-enabled
by
the
end
of
July
.
Cisco
Talos
observed
threat
actors
reacting
to
these
changes
by
moving
away
from
malicious
macros
as
an
initial
access
method
in
favor
of
other
types
of
executable
attachments
.
While
tracking
some
prevalent
commodity
malware
threat
actors
,
Talos
observed
the
popularization
of
malicious
LNK
files
as
their
initial
access
method
to
download
and
execute
payloads
.
A
closer
look
at
the
LNK
files
illustrates
how
their
metadata
could
be
used
to
identify
and
track
new
campaigns
.
-
Adversaries
’
shift
toward
Shell
Link
(
LNK
)
files
,
likely
sparked
by
Microsoft
’
s
decision
to
block
macros
,
provides
the
opportunity
to
capitalize
on
information
that
can
be
provided
by
LNK
metadata
.
-
Cisco
Talos
analyzed
metadata
in
LNK
files
and
correlated
it
with
threat
actors
tactics
techniques
and
procedures
,
to
identify
and
track
threat
actor
activity
.
This
report
outlines
our
research
on
Qakbot
and
Gamaredon
as
examples
.
-
Talos
also
used
LNK
file
metadata
to
identify
relationships
among
different
threat
actors
.
In
this
report
we
demonstrate
this
by
using
metadata
to
connect
Bumblebee
with
IcedID
and
Qakbot
respectively
.
