In
Splunk
Enterprise
and
Universal
Forwarder
versions
before
9.0
,
the
Splunk
command-line
interface
(
CLI
)
did
not
validate
TLS
certificates
while
connecting
to
a
remote
Splunk
platform
instance
by
default
.
Splunk
peer
communications
configured
properly
with
valid
certificates
were
not
vulnerable
.
However
,
connections
from
misconfigured
nodes
without
valid
certificates
did
not
fail
by
default
.
After
updating
to
version
9.0
,
see
Configure
TLS
host
name
validation
for
the
Splunk
CLI
(
https

//docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation
#
Configure_TLS_host_name_validation_for_the_Splunk_CLI
)
to
enable
the
remediation
.
