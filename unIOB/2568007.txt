An
attacker
examines
a
target
system
to
find
sensitive
data
that
has
been
embedded
within
it
.
This
information
can
reveal
confidential
contents
,
such
as
account
numbers
or
individual
keys/credentials
that
can
be
used
as
an
intermediate
step
in
a
larger
attack
.
In
order
to
feasibly
execute
this
type
of
attack
,
some
valuable
data
must
be
present
in
client
software
.
Additionally
,
this
information
must
be
unprotected
,
or
protected
in
a
flawed
fashion
,
or
through
a
mechanism
that
fails
to
resist
reverse
