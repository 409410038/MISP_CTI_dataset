Overflow
Variables
and
Tags
.
This
type
of
attack
leverages
the
use
of
tags
or
variables
from
a
formatted
configuration
data
to
cause
buffer
overflow
.
The
attacker
crafts
a
malicious
HTML
page
or
configuration
file
that
includes
oversized
strings
,
thus
causing
an
overflow
.
The
target
program
consumes
user-controllable
data
in
the
form
of
tags
or
variables
.
The
target
program
does
not
perform
sufficient
boundary
checking
.
Use
a
language
or
compiler
that
performs
automatic
bounds
checking
.
Use
an
abstraction
library
to
abstract
away
risky
APIs
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
Compiler-based
canary
mechanisms
such
as
StackGuard
,
ProPolice
and
the
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
/GS
flag
.
Unless
this
provides
automatic
bounds
checking
,
it
is
not
a
complete
solution
.
Use
OS-level
preventative
functionality
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
Do
not
trust
input
data
from
user
.
Validate
all
user
input
