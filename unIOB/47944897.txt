Mandiant
Consulting
â€™
s
investigation
of
the
3CX
supply
chain
compromise
has
uncovered
the
initial
intrusion
vector
:
a
malware-laced
software
package
distributed
via
an
earlier
software
supply
chain
compromise
that
began
with
a
tampered
installer
for
X_TRADER
,
a
software
package
provided
by
Trading
Technologies
(
Figure

)
.
Mandiant
determined
that
a
complex
loading
process
led
to
the
deployment
of
VEILEDSIGNAL
,
a
multi-stage
modular
backdoor
,
and
its
modules
.
