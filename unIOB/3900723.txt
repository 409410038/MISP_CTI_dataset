Threat
Actors
(
TAs
)
are
increasingly
using
spam
emails
and
phishing
websites
to
trick
users
into
downloading
malware
such
as
Stealer
and
Remote
Access
Trojan
(
RAT
)
to
infect
users
’
machines
and
steal
sensitive
information
.
Cyble
Research
&
Intelligence
Labs
(
CRIL
)
is
actively
monitoring
various
stealer
malware
and
publishing
blogs
about
them
to
inform
and
educate
its
readers
.
Recently
,
we
came
across
a
new
strain
of
malware
called
“
Rhadamanthys
Stealer.
”
This
stealer
variant
is
active
,
and
the
TA
behind
the
malware
stealer
is
selling
this
under
the
Malware
as
a
Service
(
MaaS
)
model
.
Rhadamanthys
stealer
spreads
by
using
Google
Ads
that
redirect
the
user
to
phishing
websites
that
mimic
popular
software
such
as
Zoom
,
AnyDesk
,
Notepad++
,
Bluestacks
,
etc
.
It
can
also
spread
via
spam
email
containing
an
attachment
for
delivering
the
malicious
payload
.
