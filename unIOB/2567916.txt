File
Content
Injection
.
An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
the
host
's
trust
in
executing
remote
content
,
including
binary
files
.
The
files
are
poisoned
with
a
malicious
payload
(
targeting
the
file
systems
accessible
by
the
target
software
)
by
the
adversary
and
may
be
passed
through
standard
channels
such
as
via
email
,
and
standard
web
content
like
PDF
and
multimedia
files
.
The
adversary
exploits
known
vulnerabilities
or
handling
routines
in
the
target
processes
.
Vulnerabilities
of
this
type
have
been
found
in
a
wide
variety
of
commercial
applications
from
Microsoft
Office
to
Adobe
Acrobat
and
Apple
Safari
web
browser
.
When
the
adversary
knows
the
standard
handling
routines
and
can
identify
vulnerabilities
and
entry
points
,
they
can
be
exploited
by
otherwise
seemingly
normal
content
.
Once
the
attack
is
executed
,
the
adversary
's
program
can
access
relative
directories
such
as
%
PROGRAMFILES
%
\or
other
standard
system
directories
to
launch
further
attacks
.
In
a
worst
case
scenario
,
these
programs
are
combined
with
other
propagation
logic
and
work
as
a
virus
.
The
target
software
must
consume
files
.
The
adversary
must
have
access
to
modify
files
that
the
target
software
will
consume
.
Design
:
Enforce
principle
of
least
privilege
Design
:
Validate
all
input
for
content
including
files
.
Ensure
that
if
files
and
remote
content
must
be
accepted
that
once
accepted
,
they
are
placed
in
a
sandbox
type
location
so
that
lower
assurance
clients
can
not
write
up
to
higher
assurance
processes
(
like
Web
server
processes
for
example
)
Design
:
Execute
programs
with
constrained
privileges
,
so
parent
process
does
not
open
up
further
vulnerabilities
.
Ensure
that
all
directories
,
temporary
directories
and
files
,
and
memory
are
executing
with
limited
privileges
to
protect
against
remote
execution
.
Design
:
Proxy
communication
to
host
,
so
that
communications
are
terminated
at
the
proxy
,
sanitizing
the
requests
before
forwarding
to
server
host
.
Implementation
:
Virus
scanning
on
host
Implementation
:
Host
integrity
monitoring
for
critical
files
,
directories
,
and
processes
.
The
goal
of
host
integrity
monitoring
is
to
be
aware
when
a
security
issue
has
occurred
so
that
incident
response
and
other
forensic
activities
can
begin
.
