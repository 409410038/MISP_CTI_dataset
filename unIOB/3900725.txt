The
joint
police
operation
that
brought
down
the
Cabassous
network
infrastructure
in
May
2022
,
together
with
the
slow
but
steady
disappearance
of
Anatsa
from
the
threat
landscape
,
left
an
open
space
in
the
Android
banking
malware
market
.
This
space
was
filled
initially
by
Hydra
,
and
in
minor
part
by
the
latest
variants
of
ExobotCompact
(
also
known
as
Octo
)
.
These
two
malware
families
stood
out
from
the
rest
due
to
their
advanced
features
,
specifically
the
ability
to
perform
Device
Take-Over
(
DTO
)
,
by
being
able
to
remotely
view
and
interact
with
the
screen
of
the
infected
device
.
In
terms
of
volume
,
ThreatFabric
observed
only
one
other
family
which
was
comparable
to
these
two
:
Ermac
.
Discovered
in
September
2021
by
our
researchers
,
this
malware
family
is
a
spawn
from
the
infamous
Android
Banker
Cerberus
.
Among
the
three
,
Hydra
is
by
far
the
most
spread
,
and
has
been
the
Android
banker
of
choice
for
threat
actors
ever
since
the
takedown
of
Cabassous
in
May
2022
.
However
,
the
other
two
malware
families
have
kept
their
numbers
quite
high
,
with
ExobotCompact/Octo
being
slightly
lower
due
to
its
distribution
mechanism
of
choice
,
dropper
applications
on
Google
Play
Store
,
which
usually
creates
less
builds
,
but
produce
more
infections
per
malicious
sample
.
