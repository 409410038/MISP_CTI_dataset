This
attack
exploits
target
software
that
constructs
SQL
statements
based
on
user
input
.
An
attacker
crafts
input
strings
so
that
when
the
target
software
constructs
SQL
statements
based
on
the
input
,
the
resulting
SQL
statement
performs
actions
other
than
those
the
application
intended
.
SQL
Injection
results
from
failure
of
the
application
to
appropriately
validate
input
.
When
specially
crafted
user-controlled
input
consisting
of
SQL
syntax
is
used
without
proper
validation
as
part
of
SQL
queries
,
it
is
possible
to
glean
information
from
the
database
in
ways
not
envisaged
during
application
design
.
Depending
upon
the
database
and
the
design
of
the
application
,
it
may
also
be
possible
to
leverage
injection
to
have
the
database
execute
system-related
commands
of
the
attackers
'
choice
.
SQL
Injection
enables
an
attacker
to
talk
directly
to
the
database
,
thus
bypassing
the
application
completely
.
Successful
injection
can
cause
information
disclosure
as
well
as
ability
to
add
or
modify
data
in
the
database
.
In
order
to
successfully
inject
SQL
and
retrieve
information
from
a
database
,
an
attacker
:
Strong
input
validation
-
All
user-controllable
input
must
be
validated
and
filtered
for
illegal
characters
as
well
as
SQL
content
.
Keywords
such
as
UNION
,
SELECT
or
INSERT
must
be
filtered
in
addition
to
characters
such
as
a
single-quote
(
'
)
or
SQL-comments
(
--
)
based
on
the
context
in
which
they
appear
.
Use
of
parameterized
queries
or
stored
procedures
-
Parameterization
causes
the
input
to
be
restricted
to
certain
domains
,
such
as
strings
or
integers
,
and
any
input
outside
such
domains
is
considered
invalid
and
the
query
fails
.
Note
that
SQL
Injection
is
possible
even
in
the
presence
of
stored
procedures
if
the
eventual
query
is
constructed
dynamically
.
Use
of
custom
error
pages
-
Attackers
can
glean
information
about
the
nature
of
queries
from
descriptive
error
messages
.
Input
validation
must
be
coupled
with
customized
error
pages
that
inform
about
an
error
without
disclosing
information
about
the
database
or
application
.
