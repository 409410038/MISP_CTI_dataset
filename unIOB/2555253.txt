At
the
end
of
2019
,
Positive
Technologies
Expert
Security
Center
(
PT
ESC
)
found
a
phishing
email
aimed
at
a
Russian
aerospace
enterprise
.
It
contained
a
link
to
previously
unknown
malware
.
Our
experts
discovered
the
same
malware
in
2020
when
investigating
an
information
security
incident
at
a
Russian
government
agency
.
During
the
investigation
,
several
new
malware
families
using
a
common
network
infrastructure
were
also
discovered
,
some
of
which
had
not
previously
been
mentioned
in
open
sources
.
In
the
summer
of
2021
,
PT
ESC
revealed
traces
of
compromise
of
another
Russian
aerospace
enterprise
.
The
organization
was
duly
informed
.
As
a
result
of
the
investigation
,
we
found
connections
to
the
same
network
infrastructure
on
its
computers
.
Further
research
made
it
possible
to
identify
at
least
two
more
organizations
in
Russia
,
both
partially
state-owned
,
that
were
attacked
using
the
same
malware
and
network
infrastructure
.
We
could
not
unambiguously
link
the
detected
malicious
activity
to
any
known
hacker
group
,
so
we
gave
the
attackers
a
new
nameâ€”Space
Pirates
.
The
reason
for
the
name
was
the
P1Rat
string
used
in
the
PDB
paths
,
and
the
targeting
of
the
aerospace
industry
.
This
report
describes
the
group
's
detected
activity
,
the
features
of
the
malware
it
uses
,
as
well
as
its
connection
with
other
APT
groups
.
General
information
We
assume
that
Space
Pirates
has
Asian
roots
,
as
indicated
by
the
active
use
of
the
Chinese
language
in
resources
,
SFX
archives
,
and
paths
to
PDB
files
.
In
addition
,
the
group
's
toolkit
includes
the
Royal
Road
RTF
(
or
8.t
)
builder
(
common
among
hackers
of
Asian
origin
)
and
the
PcShare
backdoor
,
and
almost
all
intersections
with
previously
known
activity
are
associated
with
APT
groups
in
the
Asian
region
.
The
group
began
its
activity
no
later
than
2017
.
The
main
targets
of
the
criminals
are
espionage
and
theft
of
confidential
information
.
Among
the
victims
identified
during
the
threat
study
are
government
agencies
and
IT
departments
,
as
well
as
aerospace
and
power
enterprises
in
Russia
,
Georgia
,
and
Mongolia
.
At
least
five
organizations
were
attacked
in
Russia
,
one
in
Georgia
,
and
the
exact
number
of
victims
in
Mongolia
is
unknown
.
Some
APT
group
attacks
using
malware
were
also
targeted
at
Chinese
financial
companies
,
which
suggests
a
monetary
motivation
.
All
potential
victims
were
notified
by
the
respective
national
CERTs
.
At
least
two
attacks
on
Russian
organizations
can
be
considered
successful
.
In
the
first
case
,
the
attackers
gained
access
to
at
least
20
servers
on
the
corporate
network
,
where
they
remained
for
about
10
months
.
During
this
time
,
more
than
1,500
internal
documents
were
stolen
,
as
well
as
information
about
all
employee
accounts
in
one
of
the
network
domains
.
In
the
second
case
,
the
attackers
managed
to
gain
persistence
in
the
company
's
network
and
remain
there
for
more
than
a
year
,
obtain
information
about
the
computers
on
the
network
,
and
install
malware
on
at
least
12
corporate
nodes
in
three
different
regions
.
The
Space
Pirates
toolkit
includes
unique
downloaders
and
several
backdoors
which
we
have
not
previously
encountered
and
which
are
presumably
specific
to
the
group
:
MyKLoadClient
,
BH_A006
,
and
Deed
RAT
.
The
criminals
also
have
access
to
the
Zupdax
backdoor
:
its
modern
variants
use
a
similar
MyKLoadClient
execution
scheme
;
however
,
the
code
of
the
backdoor
itself
dates
back
to
2010
and
can
not
be
uniquely
attributed
to
the
group
.
In
addition
,
the
attackers
use
well-known
malware
,
such
as
PlugX
,
ShadowPad
,
Poison
Ivy
,
a
modified
version
of
PcShare
,
and
the
public
shell
ReVBShell
.
The
dog-tunnel
utility
is
used
to
tunnel
traffic
.
The
main
network
infrastructure
of
the
group
uses
a
small
number
of
IP
addresses
indicated
by
DDNS
domains
.
Interestingly
,
the
attackers
use
not
only
third-level
domains
,
but
also
fourth-
and
higher-level
ones
,
for
example
,
w.asd3.as.amazon-corp.wikaba.com
.
In
the
process
of
investigating
Space
Pirates
,
we
found
a
large
number
of
intersections
with
previously
identified
activity
,
which
researchers
associate
with
the
following
groups
:
Winnti
(
APT41
)
,
Bronze
Union
(
APT27
)
,
TA428
,
RedFoxtrot
,
Mustang
Panda
,
and
Night
Dragon
.
The
reason
for
this
is
probably
the
exchange
of
tools
between
groups
,
which
is
common
practice
for
APT
groups
in
the
Asian
region
.
The
connection
between
the
Space
Pirates
and
TA428
groups
should
be
specially
noted
.
As
part
of
another
investigation
,
we
observed
the
activities
of
both
groups
on
infected
computers
,
which
,
however
,
had
no
intersections
in
the
network
infrastructure
.
During
Operation
StealthyTrident
,
described
by
ESET
,
the
attackers
used
Tmanger
,
attributed
to
TA428
,
and
Zupdax
,
associated
with
Space
Pirates
.
The
connection
with
another
TA428
malware
,
in
particular
Albaniiutas
(
RemShell
)
,
and
Zupdax
can
also
be
traced
in
the
network
infrastructure
adjacent
to
the
one
mentioned
in
the
ESET
report
.
All
this
suggests
that
Space
Pirates
and
TA428
can
combine
their
efforts
and
share
tools
,
network
resources
,
and
access
to
infected
systems
.
The
key
connections
between
the
affected
organizations
,
malware
families
,
and
fragments
of
the
network
infrastructure
,
as
well
as
public
information
about
the
attackers
,
can
be
seen
in
Figure
1
.
Later
in
the
report
,
we
will
give
more
details
about
them
.
