sing
malicious
Google
Ads
or
SEO
poisoning
to
distribute
malware
has
become
a
common
tactic
for
cybercriminals
.
For
example
,
in
the
Secureworks®
2022
State
of
the
Threat
report
,
Counter
Threat
Unit™
(
CTU
)
researchers
described
legitimate
web
searches
being
hijacked
by
SEO
poisoning
to
infect
victims
’
systems
with
Gootloader
,
and
malicious
Google
Ads
bundling
infostealers
like
RedLine
in
trojanized
installers
for
messaging
apps
such
as
Signal
.
Recently
,
CTU™
researchers
observed
Bumblebee
malware
distributed
via
trojanized
installers
for
popular
software
such
as
Zoom
,
Cisco
AnyConnect
,
ChatGPT
,
and
Citrix
Workspace
.
Bumblebee
is
a
modular
loader
,
historically
distributed
primarily
through
phishing
,
that
has
been
used
to
deliver
payloads
commonly
associated
with
ransomware
deployments
.
Trojanizing
installers
for
software
that
is
particularly
topical
(
e.g.
,
ChatGPT
)
or
software
commonly
used
by
remote
workers
increases
the
likelihood
of
new
infections
.
One
of
the
Bumblebee
samples
CTU
researchers
analyzed
was
downloaded
from
http
:
//appcisco
.
com/vpncleint/cisco-anyconnect-4_9_0195.msi
.
On
or
around
February
16
,
2023
,
a
threat
actor
created
a
fake
download
page
for
Cisco
AnyConnect
Secure
Mobility
Client
v4.x
(
see
Figure
1
)
on
the
appcisco
.
com
domain
.
An
infection
chain
that
began
with
a
malicious
Google
Ad
sent
the
user
to
this
fake
download
page
via
a
compromised
WordPress
site
.
