Session
Credential
Falsification
through
Prediction
.
This
attack
targets
predictable
session
ID
in
order
to
gain
privileges
.
The
attacker
can
predict
the
session
ID
used
during
a
transaction
to
perform
spoofing
and
session
hijacking
.
The
target
host
uses
session
IDs
to
keep
track
of
the
users
.
Session
IDs
are
used
to
control
access
to
resources
.
The
session
IDs
used
by
the
target
host
are
predictable
.
For
example
,
the
session
IDs
are
generated
using
predictable
information
(
e.g.
,
time
)
.
Use
a
strong
source
of
randomness
to
generate
a
session
ID
.
Use
adequate
length
session
IDs
Do
not
use
information
available
to
the
user
in
order
to
generate
session
ID
(
e.g.
,
time
)
.
Ideas
for
creating
random
numbers
are
offered
by
Eastlake
[
RFC1750
]
Encrypt
the
session
ID
if
you
expose
it
to
the
user
.
For
instance
session
ID
can
be
stored
in
a
cookie
in
encrypted
format
.
