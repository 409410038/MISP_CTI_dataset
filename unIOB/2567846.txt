An
adversary
crafts
a
request
to
a
target
that
results
in
the
target
listing/indexing
the
content
of
a
directory
as
output
.
One
common
method
of
triggering
directory
contents
as
output
is
to
construct
a
request
containing
a
path
that
terminates
in
a
directory
name
rather
than
a
file
name
since
many
applications
are
configured
to
provide
a
list
of
the
directory
's
contents
when
such
a
request
is
received
.
An
adversary
can
use
this
to
explore
the
directory
tree
on
a
target
as
well
as
learn
the
names
of
files
.
This
can
often
end
up
revealing
test
files
,
backup
files
,
temporary
files
,
hidden
files
,
configuration
files
,
user
accounts
,
script
contents
,
as
well
as
naming
conventions
,
all
of
which
can
be
used
by
an
attacker
to
mount
additional
attacks
.
The
target
must
be
misconfigured
to
return
a
list
of
a
directory's
content
when
it
receives
a
request
that
ends
in
a
directory
name
rather
than
a
file
name
.
The
adversary
must
be
able
to
control
the
path
that
is
requested
of
the
target
.
The
administrator
must
have
failed
to
properly
configure
an
ACL
or
has
associated
an
overly
permissive
ACL
with
a
particular
directory
.
The
server
version
or
patch
level
must
not
inherently
prevent
known
directory
listing
attacks
from
working
.

Using
blank

:
putting
blank
index.html
simply
prevent
directory
listings
from
displaying
to
site
visitors
