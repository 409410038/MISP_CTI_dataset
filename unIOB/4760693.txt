EvilExtractor
(
sometimes
spelled
Evil
Extractor
)
is
an
attack
tool
designed
to
target
Windows
operating
systems
and
extract
data
and
files
from
endpoint
devices
.
It
includes
several
modules
that
all
work
via
an
FTP
service
.
It
was
developed
by
a
company
named
Kodex
,
which
claims
it
is
an
educational
tool
.
However
,
research
conducted
by
FortiGuard
Labs
shows
cybercriminals
are
actively
using
it
as
an
info
stealer
.
Based
on
our
traffic
source
data
to
the
host
,
evilextractor
[
.
]
com
,
malicious
activity
increased
significantly
in
March
2023
.
FortiGuard
Labs
observed
this
malware
in
a
phishing
email
campaign
on
30
March
,
which
we
traced
back
to
the
samples
included
in
this
blog
.
It
usually
pretends
to
be
a
legitimate
file
,
such
as
an
Adobe
PDF
or
Dropbox
file
,
but
once
loaded
,
it
begins
to
leverage
PowerShell
malicious
activities
.
It
also
contains
environment
checking
and
Anti-VM
functions
.
Its
primary
purpose
seems
to
be
to
steal
browser
data
and
information
from
compromised
endpoints
and
then
upload
it
to
the
attacker
’
s
FTP
server
.
We
recently
reviewed
a
version
of
the
malware
that
was
injected
into
a
victim
’
s
system
and
,
as
part
of
that
analysis
,
identified
that
most
of
its
victims
are
located
in
Europe
and
America
.
The
developer
released
its
project
in
October
2022
(
Figure
1
)
and
has
kept
updating
it
to
increase
its
stability
and
strengthen
its
module
.
This
article
will
examine
the
initial
attack
method
used
to
deliver
EvilExtractor
and
its
functions
.
