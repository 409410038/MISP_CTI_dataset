An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
a
programs
'
vulnerabilities
that
allows
an
attacker
's
commands
to
be
concatenated
onto
a
legitimate
command
with
the
intent
of
targeting
other
resources
such
as
the
file
system
or
database
.
The
system
that
uses
a
filter
or
a
blacklist
input
validation
,
as
opposed
to
whitelist
validation
is
vulnerable
to
an
attacker
who
predicts
delimiters
(
or
combinations
of
delimiters
)
not
present
in
the
filter
or
blacklist
.
As
with
other
injection
attacks
,
the
attacker
uses
the
command
delimiter
payload
as
an
entry
point
to
tunnel
through
the
application
and
activate
additional
attacks
through
SQL
queries
,
shell
commands
,
network
scanning
,
and
so
on
.
Software's
input
validation
or
filtering
must
not
detect
and
block
presence
of
additional
malicious
command
.
Design
:
Perform
whitelist
validation
against
a
positive
specification
for
command
length
,
type
,
and
parameters
.
Design
:
Limit
program
privileges
,
so
if
commands
circumvent
program
input
validation
or
filter
routines
then
commands
do
not
running
under
a
privileged
account
Implementation
:
Perform
input
validation
for
all
remote
content
.
Implementation
:
Use
type
conversions
such
as
JDBC
prepared
statements
.
