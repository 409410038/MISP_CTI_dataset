Using
Unicode
Encoding
to
Bypass
Validation
Logic
An
attacker
may
provide
a
Unicode
string
to
a
system
component
that
is
not
Unicode
aware
and
use
that
to
circumvent
the
filter
or
cause
the
classifying
mechanism
to
fail
to
properly
understanding
the
request
.
That
may
allow
the
attacker
to
slip
malicious
data
past
the
content
filter
and/or
possibly
cause
the
application
to
route
the
request
incorrectly
.
Filtering
is
performed
on
data
that
has
not
be
properly
canonicalized
.
Ensure
that
the
system
is
Unicode
aware
and
can
properly
process
Unicode
data
.
Do
not
make
an
assumption
that
data
will
be
in
ASCII
.
Ensure
that
filtering
or
input
validation
is
applied
to
canonical
data
.
Assume
all
input
is
malicious
.
Create
a
white
list
that
defines
all
valid
input
to
the
software
system
based
on
the
requirements
specifications
.
Input
that
does
not
match
against
the
white
list
should
not
be
permitted
to
enter
into
the
system
.
