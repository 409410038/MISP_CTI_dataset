A
legitimate
and
signed
Notepad++
updater
has
been
renamed
SearchIndexer.exe
by
the
malware
,
which
is
the
name
of
a
legitimate
Windows
file
.
The
Notepad++
updater
loads
the
libcurl
library
,
SparrowDoor
takes
advantage
of
this
,
as
the
malicious
loader
is
given
the
same
name
as
the
legitimate
libcurl
library
and
is
side-loaded
into
the
renamed
Notepad++
updater
process
SearchIndexer.exe
.
