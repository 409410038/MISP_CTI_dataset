Bluebottle
,
a
cyber-crime
group
that
specializes
in
targeted
attacks
against
the
financial
sector
,
is
continuing
to
mount
attacks
on
banks
in
Francophone
countries
.
The
group
makes
extensive
use
of
living
off
the
land
,
dual-use
tools
,
and
commodity
malware
,
with
no
custom
malware
deployed
in
this
campaign
.
The
activity
observed
by
Symantec
,
a
division
of
Broadcom
Software
,
appears
to
be
a
continuation
of
activity
documented
in
a
Group-IB
report
from
November
2022
.
The
activity
documented
by
Group-IB
spanned
from
mid-2019
to
2021
,
and
it
said
that
during
that
period
this
group
,
which
it
called
OPERA1ER
,
stole
at
least
$
11
million
in
the
course
of
30
targeted
attacks
.
Similarities
in
the
tactics
,
techniques
,
and
procedures
(
TTPs
)
between
the
activity
documented
by
Group-IB
and
the
activity
seen
by
Symantec
include
:
Same
domain

in
both
sets
of
activity
:

Some
of
the
same
tools

Cobalt
Strike
Beacon
No
custom
malware
found
in
either
set
of
activity
The
crossover
in
targeting
of
French-speaking
nations
in
Africa
Both
sets
of
activity
also
feature
the
use
of
industry-specific
,
and
region-specific
,
domain
names
While
this
does
appear
to
be
a
continuation
of
the
activity
documented
by
Group-IB
,
the
activity
seen
by
Symantec
is
more
recent
,
running
from
at
least
July
2022
to
September
2022
,
though
some
of
the
activity
may
have
begun
as
far
back
as
May
2022
.
Some
new
TTPs
have
also
been
employed
in
recent
attacks
,
including
:
Some
indications
the
attackers
may
have
used
ISO
files
as
an
initial
infection
vector
The
use
of
the
commodity
malware
GuLoader
in
the
initial
stages
of
the
attack
Indications
the
attackers
have
adopted
the
technique
of
abusing
kernel
drivers
to
disable
defenses
