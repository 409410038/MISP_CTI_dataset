This
type
of
attack
involves
an
adversary
that
exploits
weaknesses
in
an
application's
use
of
sessions
in
performing
authentication
.
The
advarsary
is
able
to
steal
or
manipulate
an
active
session
and
use
it
to
gain
unathorized
access
to
the
application
.
An
application
that
leverages
sessions
to
perform
authentication
.
Properly
encrypt
and
sign
identity
tokens
in
transit
,
and
use
industry
standard
session
key
generation
mechanisms
that
utilize
high
amount
of
entropy
to
generate
the
session
key
.
Many
standard
web
and
application
servers
will
perform
this
task
on
your
behalf
.
Utilize
a
session
timeout
for
all
sessions
.
If
the
user
does
not
explicitly
logout
,
terminate
their
session
after
this
period
of
inactivity
.
If
the
user
logs
back
in
then
a
new
session
key
should
be
generated
.
