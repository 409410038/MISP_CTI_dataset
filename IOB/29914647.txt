In
this
attack
,
the
idea
is
to
cause
an
active
filter
to
fail
by
causing
an
oversized
transaction
.
An
attacker
may
try
to
feed
overly
long
input
strings
to
the
program
in
an
attempt
to
overwhelm
the
filter
(
by
causing
a
buffer
overflow
)
and
hoping
that
the
filter
does
not
fail
securely
(
i.e
.
the
user
input
is
let
into
the
system
unfiltered
)
.
