A
Denial
of
Service
vulnerability
exists
in
qs
up
to
6.8.0
due
to
insufficient
sanitization
of
property
in
the
gs.parse
function
.
The
merge
(
)
function
allows
the
assignment
of
properties
on
an
array
in
the
query
.
For
any
property
being
assigned
,
a
value
in
the
array
is
converted
to
an
object
containing
these
properties
.
Essentially
,
this
means
that
the
property
whose
expected
type
is
Array
always
has
to
be
checked
with
Array.isArray
(
)
by
the
user
.
This
may
not
be
obvious
to
the
user
and
can
cause
unexpected
behavior
.
