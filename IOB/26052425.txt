Minerva
Labs
have
often
observed
threat
actors
using
legitimate
software
for
dropping
malicious
files
.
This
time
however
is
different
.
This
threat
actor
was
able
to
leave
most
parts
of
the
attack
under
the
radar
by
separating
the
attack
into
several
small
files
,
most
of
which
had
very
low
detection
rates
by
AV
engines
,
with
the
final
stage
leading
to
Purple
Fox
rootkit
