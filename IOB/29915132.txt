An
attacker
can
craft
special
user-controllable
input
consisting
of
XPath
expressions
to
inject
the
XML
database
and
bypass
authentication
or
glean
information
that
he
normally
would
not
be
able
to
.
XPath
Injection
enables
an
attacker
to
talk
directly
to
the
XML
database
,
thus
bypassing
the
application
completely
.
XPath
Injection
results
from
the
failure
of
an
application
to
properly
sanitize
input
used
as
part
of
dynamic
XPath
expressions
used
to
query
an
XML
database
.
