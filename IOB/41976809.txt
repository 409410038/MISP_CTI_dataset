Those
using
JXPath
to
interpret
untrusted
XPath
expressions
may
be
vulnerable
to
a
remote
code
execution
attack
.
All
JXPathContext
class
functions
processing
a
XPath
string
are
vulnerable
except
compile
(
)
and
compilePath
(
)
function
.
The
XPath
expression
can
be
used
by
an
attacker
to
load
any
Java
class
from
the
classpath
resulting
in
code
execution
.
