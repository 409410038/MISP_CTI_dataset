This
type
of
attack
is
a
form
of
Cross-Site
Scripting
(
XSS
)
where
a
malicious
script
is
inserted
into
the
client-side
HTML
being
parsed
by
a
web
browser
.
Content
served
by
a
vulnerable
web
application
includes
script
code
used
to
manipulate
the
Document
Object
Model
(
DOM
)
.
This
script
code
either
does
not
properly
validate
input
,
or
does
not
perform
proper
output
encoding
,
thus
creating
an
opportunity
for
an
adversary
to
inject
a
malicious
script
launch
a
XSS
attack
.
A
key
distinction
between
other
XSS
attacks
and
DOM-based
attacks
is
that
in
other
XSS
attacks
,
the
malicious
script
runs
when
the
vulnerable
web
page
is
initially
loaded
,
while
a
DOM-based
attack
executes
sometime
after
the
page
loads
.
Another
distinction
of
DOM-based
attacks
is
that
in
some
cases
,
the
malicious
script
is
never
sent
to
the
vulnerable
web
server
at
all
.
An
attack
like
this
is
guaranteed
to
bypass
any
server-side
filtering
attempts
to
protect
users
.
