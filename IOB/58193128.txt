Threat
actors
have
begun
capitalizing
on
the
explosive
popularity
of
AI
tools
as
more
people
use
them
to
optimize
their
work
processes
.
As
such
,
it
is
important
for
both
organizations
and
individuals
to
continue
being
vigilant
when
it
comes
to
the
apps
and
tools
they
download
and
use
.
Users
should
avoid
clicking
on
suspicious
ads
and
downloading
unverified
or
unofficial
apps
since
they
can
lead
to
malware
infections
and
other
malicious
behavior
.
Many
AI
tools
,
such
as
ChatGPT
and
Midjourney
,
do
not
have
desktop
or
app
versions
,
so
if
one
is
being
offered
for
download
,
then
there
is
a
high
chance
that
this
is
malicious
.
The
rising
popularity
of
artificial
intelligence
(
AI
)
tools
such
as
ChatGPT
has
made
them
attractive
targets
for
threat
actors
who
are
now
exploiting
them
as
social
engineering
ploys
to
entice
victims
into
downloading
malware
droppers
that
ultimately
result
in
the
deployment
of
stealers
like
Vidar
and
Redline
.
Recently
,
we
¡¦
ve
been
observing
malicious
advertisement
campaigns
in
Google
¡¦
s
search
engine
with
themes
that
are
related
to
AI
tools
.
Figure
1
shows
some
examples
of
malicious
ads
served
when
a
user
searches
for
the
keyword
``
midjourney
''
in
Google
(
note
that
Midjourney
is
an
AI
tool
that
generates
images
from
natural
language
descriptions
)
