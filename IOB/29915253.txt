This
attack
relies
on
the
use
of
HTTP
Cookies
to
store
credentials
,
state
information
and
other
critical
data
on
client
systems
.
There
are
several
different
forms
of
this
attack
.
The
first
form
of
this
attack
involves
accessing
HTTP
Cookies
to
mine
for
potentially
sensitive
data
contained
therein
.
The
second
form
involves
intercepting
this
data
as
it
is
transmitted
from
client
to
server
.
This
intercepted
information
is
then
used
by
the
adversary
to
impersonate
the
remote
user/session
.
The
third
form
is
when
the
cookie
's
content
is
modified
by
the
adversary
before
it
is
sent
back
to
the
server
.
Here
the
adversary
seeks
to
convince
the
target
server
to
operate
on
this
falsified
information
.
