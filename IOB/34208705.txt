If
the
devices
are
compromised
,
they
will
be
fully
controlled
by
attackers
,
who
could
utilize
those
devices
to
conduct
further
attacks
such
as
distributed
denial-of-service
(
DDoS
)
attacks
.
The
exploit
attempts
captured
by
Unit

researchers
leverage
the
aforementioned
vulnerabilities
to
spread
MooBot
,
a
Mirai
variant
,
which
targets
exposed
networking
devices
running
Linux
.
While
D-Link
has
published
security
bulletins
regarding
all
the
vulnerabilities
mentioned
here
,
some
users
may
be
running
unpatched
or
older

strongly
recommends
applying
upgrades
and
patches
where
possible
.
