One
solution
to
this
problem
is
to
protect
encrypted
data
with
a
CRC
of
some
sort
.
If
knowing
who
last
manipulated
the
data
is
important
,
then
using
a
cryptographic
``
message
authentication
code
''
(
or
hMAC
)
is
prescribed
.
However
,
this
guidance
is
not
a
panacea
.
In
particular
,
any
value
created
by
(
and
therefore
encrypted
by
)
the
client
,
which
itself
is
a
``
malicious
''
value
,
all
the
protective
cryptography
in
the
world
ca
n't
make
the
value
'correct
'
again
.
Put
simply
,
if
the
client
has
control
over
the
whole
process
of
generating
and
encoding
the
value
,
then
simply
protecting
its
integrity
does
n't
help
.
Make
sure
to
protect
client
side
authentication
tokens
for
confidentiality
(
encryption
)
and
integrity
(
signed
hash
)
Make
sure
that
all
session
tokens
use
a
good
source
of
randomness
Perform
validation
on
the
server
side
to
make
sure
that
client
side
data
tokens
are
consistent
with
what
is
expected
.
