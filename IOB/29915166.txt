An
attacker
leverages
a
weakness
present
in
the
database
access
layer
code
generated
with
an
Object
Relational
Mapping
(
ORM
)
tool
or
a
weakness
in
the
way
that
a
developer
used
a
persistence
framework
to
inject
his
or
her
own
SQL
commands
to
be
executed
against
the
underlying
database
.
The
attack
here
is
similar
to
plain
SQL
injection
,
except
that
the
application
does
not
use
JDBC
to
directly
talk
to
the
database
,
but
instead
it
uses
a
data
access
layer
generated
by
an
ORM
tool
or
framework
(
e.g
.
Hibernate
)
.
While
most
of
the
time
code
generated
by
an
ORM
tool
contains
safe
access
methods
that
are
immune
to
SQL
injection
,
sometimes
either
due
to
some
weakness
in
the
generated
code
or
due
to
the
fact
that
the
developer
failed
to
use
the
generated
access
methods
properly
,
SQL
injection
is
still
possible
.
