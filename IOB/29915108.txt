An
attacker
may
provide
a
Unicode
string
to
a
system
component
that
is
not
Unicode
aware
and
use
that
to
circumvent
the
filter
or
cause
the
classifying
mechanism
to
fail
to
properly
understanding
the
request
.
That
may
allow
the
attacker
to
slip
malicious
data
past
the
content
filter
and/or
possibly
cause
the
application
to
route
the
request
incorrectly
.
