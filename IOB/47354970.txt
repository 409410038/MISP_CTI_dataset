The
threat
actors
used
C
:
\MS_DATA
as
their
main
working
directory
for
storing
malware
and
staging
data
for
exfiltration
.
Noting
that
the
Microsoft
TroubleShootingScript
toolset
(
TSSv2
)
uses
C
:
\MS_DATA
for
storing
log
files
,
we
suspect
that
its
use
as
a
working
directory
is
an
attempt
to
make
malicious
file
system
activities
look
legitimate
.
