savg-sanitizer
is
a
PHP
SVG/XML
Sanitizer
.
A
bypass
has
been
found
in
versions
prior
to
0.16.0
that
allows
an
attacker
to
upload
an
SVG
with
persistent
cross-site
scripting
.
HTML
elements
within
CDATA
needed
to
be
sanitized
correctly
,
as
we
were
converting
them
to
a
textnode
and
therefore
,
the
library
was
n't
seeing
them
as
DOM
elements
.
This
issue
is
fixed
in
version
0.16.0
.
Any
data
within
a
CDATA
node
will
now
be
sanitised
using
HTMLPurifier
.
The
maintainers
have
also
removed
many
of
the
HTML
and
MathML
elements
from
the
allowed
element
list
,
as
without
ForiegnObject
,
they
're
not
legal
within
the
SVG
context
.
There
are
no
known
workarounds
.
