Ukraine
Sandworm
continues
to
conduct
attacks
against
carefully
chosen
targets
in
the
war-torn
country
ESET
researchers
have
uncovered
a
new
wiper
attack
in
Ukraine
that
they
attribute
to
the
Sandworm
APT
group
.
Dubbed
SwiftSlicer
,
the
destructive
malware
was
spotted
on
the
network
of
a
targeted
organization
on
January
25th
.
It
was
deployed
through
Group
Policy
,
which
suggests
that
the
attackers
had
taken
control
of
the
victim
¡¦
s
Active
Directory
environment
.
Some
of
the
wipers
spotted
by
ESET
in
Ukraine
early
into
Russia
¡¦
s
invasion
¡V
HermeticWiper
and
CaddyWiper
¡V
were
in
some
instances
also
planted
in
the
same
fashion
.
The
latter
was
last
spotted
on
the
network
of
Ukraine
¡¦
s
news
agency
Ukrinform
just
days
ago
.
SwiftSlicer
is
detected
by
ESET
products
as
WinGo/KillFiles.C
.
The
malware
was
written
in
Go
,
a
highly
versatile
,
cross-platform
programming
language
.
When
it
comes
to
SwiftSlicer
¡¦
s
method
of
destruction
,
ESET
researchers
had
this
to
say
:
¡§
Once
executed
it
deletes
shadow
copies
,
recursively
overwrites
files
located
in
%
CSIDL_SYSTEM
%
\drivers
,
%
CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE
%
\Windows\NTDS
and
other
non-system
drives
and
then
reboots
computer
.
For
overwriting
it
uses
4096
bytes
length
block
filled
with
randomly
generated
byte

.
Two
months
ago
,
ESET
detected
a
wave
of
RansomBoggs
ransomware
attacks
in
the
war-torn
country
that
were
also
linked
to
Sandworm
.
The
campaigns
were
just
one
of
the
latest
additions
to
the
long
