An
adversary
uses
path
manipulation
methods
to
exploit
insufficient
input
validation
of
a
target
to
obtain
access
to
data
that
should
be
not
be
retrievable
by
ordinary
well-formed
requests
.
A
typical
variety
of
this
attack
involves
specifying
a
path
to
a
desired
file
together
with
dot-dot-slash
characters
,
resulting
in
the
file
access
API
or
function
traversing
out
of
the
intended
directory
structure
and
into
the
root
file
system
.
By
replacing
or
modifying
the
expected
path
information
the
access
function
or
API
retrieves
the
file
desired
by
the
attacker
.
These
attacks
either
involve
the
attacker
providing
a
complete
path
to
a
targeted
file
or
using
control
characters
(
e.g
.
path
separators
(
/
or
\
)
and/or
dots
(
.
)
)
to
reach
desired
directories
or
files
.
