This
paper
investigates
a
recent
QakBot
phishing
campaign
's
ability
to
evade
Mark-of-the-Web
(
MoTW
)
security
features
,
allowing
for
escape
from
the
designated
security
zone
and
successful
installation
of
malicious
software
on
victim
device
..
Key
observations
:
EclecticIQ
analysts
investigated
QakBot
phishing
campaigns
switching
to
a
Zero-Day
Vulnerability
to
evade
Windows
Mark
of
the
Web
(
MoTW
)
.
QakBot
may
be
able
to
increase
its
infection
success
rate
as
a
result
of
the
switch
to
a
zero-day
exploit
.
The
threat
actor
distributes
QakBot
using
phishing
emails
with
a
malicious
URL
inside
.
When
a
victim
user
clicks
on
the
malicious
URL
,
it
starts
to
download
an
encrypted
ZIP
folder
that
contains
an
ISO
image
.
If
the
ISO
image
is
opened
by
victim
,
it
will
mount
itself
on
a
disk
and
open
another
File
Explorer
window
that
contains
the
final
QakBot
Loader
as
a
JavaScript
format
which
can
be
executed
by
a
simple
user
click
.
The
final
QakBot
Loader
(
WW.js
)
contains
a
malformed
digital
signature
to
evade
the
Mark
of
the
Web
(
MoTW
)
Security
feature
on
Windows
OS
.
¡P
EclecticIQ
analysts
observed
use
of
zero-day
vulnerabilities
is
increasing
among
non-nation
state
cyber
criminals
.
Living
off
the
Land
Binaries
(
LOLBINS
)
like
Regsvr32.exe
(
2
)
and
WScript.exe
(
3
)
are
actively
abused
to
execute
QakBot
Malware
.
