An
attack
of
this
type
involves
an
adversary
inserting
malicious
characters
(
such
as
a
XSS
redirection
)
into
a
filename
,
directly
or
indirectly
that
is
then
used
by
the
target
software
to
generate
HTML
text
or
other
potentially
executable
content
.
Many
websites
rely
on
user-generated
content
and
dynamically
build
resources
like
files
,
filenames
,
and
URL
links
directly
from
user
supplied
data
.
In
this
attack
pattern
,
the
attacker
uploads
code
that
can
execute
in
the
client
browser
and/or
redirect
the
client
browser
to
a
site
that
the
attacker
owns
.
All
XSS
attack
payload
variants
can
be
used
to
pass
and
exploit
these
vulnerabilities
.
