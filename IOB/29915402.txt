Design
:
Use
browser
technologies
that
do
not
allow
client
side
scripting
.
Design
:
Utilize
strict
type
,
character
,
and
encoding
enforcement
Design
:
Server
side
developers
should
not
proxy
content
via
XHR
or
other
means
,
if
a
http
proxy
for
remote
content
is
setup
on
the
server
side
,
the
client
's
browser
has
no
way
of
discerning
where
the
data
is
originating
from
.
Implementation
:
Ensure
all
content
that
is
delivered
to
client
is
sanitized
against
an
acceptable
content
specification
.
Implementation
:
Perform
input

There
are
many
attack
vectors
for
XSS
on
the
client
side
and
the
server
side
.
Many
vulnerabilities
are
fixed
in
service
packs
for
browser
,
web
servers
,
and
plug
in
technologies
,
staying
current
on
patch
release
that
deal
with
XSS
countermeasures
mitigates
this
.
