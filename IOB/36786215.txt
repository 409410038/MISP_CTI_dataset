forum
,
someone
wrote
that
his
files
were
encrypted
with
the
extension
¡§
Play.
¡¨
Afterward
,
Trend
Micro
published
an
analysis
article
about
the
new
ransomware
variant
,
Play
Ransomware
.
The
main
target
of
Play
Ransomware
is
the
Latin
American
region
,
and
Brazil
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
.
Even
though
they
seem
like
a
new
ransomware
group
,
their
identified
TTPs
look
like
Hive
and
Nokayawa
ransomware
families
.
One
of
the
similar
behaviors
that
make
them
look
similar
are
they
use
AdFind
,
a
command-line
query
tool
capable
of
collecting
information
from
Active
Directory
.
