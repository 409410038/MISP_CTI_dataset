There
are
two
components
communicating
with
each
other
.
An
attacker
is
able
to
identify
the
nature
and
mechanism
of
communication
between
the
two
target
components
.
An
attacker
can
eavesdrop
on
the
communication
between
the
target
components
.
Strong
mutual
authentication
is
not
used
between
the
two
target
components
yielding
opportunity
for
attacker
interposition
.
The
communication
occurs
in
clear
(
not
encrypted
)
or
with
insufficient
and
spoofable
encryption
.
