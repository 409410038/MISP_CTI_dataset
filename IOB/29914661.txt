The
program
expands
one
of
the
parameters
passed
to
a
function
with
input
controlled
by
the
user
,
but
a
later
function
making
use
of
the
expanded
parameter
erroneously
considers
the
original
,
not
the
expanded
size
of
the
parameter
.
The
expanded
parameter
is
used
in
the
context
where
buffer
overflow
may
become
possible
due
to
the
incorrect
understanding
of
the
parameter
size
(
i.e
.
thinking
that
it
is
smaller
than
it
really
is
)
.
