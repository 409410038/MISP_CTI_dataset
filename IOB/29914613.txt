This
attack
targets
libraries
or
shared
code
modules
which
are
vulnerable
to
buffer
overflow
attacks
.
An
attacker
who
has
access
to
an
API
may
try
to
embed
malicious
code
in
the
API
function
call
and
exploit
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
in
the
function's
implementation
.
All
clients
that
make
use
of
the
code
library
thus
become
vulnerable
by
association
.
This
has
a
very
broad
effect
on
security
across
a
system
,
usually
affecting
more
than
one
software
process
.
