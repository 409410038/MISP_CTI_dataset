This
year
,
ransomware-as-a-service
(
RaaS
)
groups
like
BlackCat
,
Hive
,
and
RansomExx
have
developed
versions
of
their
ransomware
in
Rust
,
a
cross-platform
language
that
makes
it
easier
to
tailor
malware
to
different
operating
systems
like
Windows
and
Linux
.
In
this
blog
entry
,
we
shed
light
on
Agenda
(
also
known
as
Qilin
)
,
another
ransomware
group
that
has
started
using
this
language
.
According
to
our
observations
in
the
past
month
,
the
Agenda
ransomware
¡¦
s
activities
included
posting
numerous
companies
on
its
leak
site
.
The
threat
actors
not
only
claimed
that
they
were
able
to
breach
the
servers
of
these
companies
but
also
threatened
to
publish
their
files
.
The
companies
that
the
ransomware
group
posts
on
its
leak
site
are
located
in
different
countries
and
belong
mostly
in
the
manufacturing
and
IT
industries
,
with
a
combined
revenue
that
surpasses
US
$
550
million
.
Recently
,
we
found
a
sample
of
the
Agenda
ransomware
written
in
Rust
language
and
detected
as
Ransom.Win32.AGENDA.THIAFBB
.
Notably
,
the
same
ransomware
,
originally
written
in
Go
language
,
was
known
for
targeting
healthcare
and
education
sectors
in
countries
like
Thailand
and
Indonesia
.
The
actors
customized
previous
ransomware
binaries
for
the
intended
victim
through
the
use
of
confidential
information
such
as
leaked
accounts
and
unique
company
IDs
as
the
appended
file
extension
.
The
Rust
variant
has
also
been
seen
using
intermittent
encryption
,
one
of
the
emerging
tactics
that
threat
actors
use
today
for
faster
encryption
and
detection
evasion
.
