This
attack
exploits
target
software
that
constructs
SQL
statements
based
on
user
input
.
An
attacker
crafts
input
strings
so
that
when
the
target
software
constructs
SQL
statements
based
on
the
input
,
the
resulting
SQL
statement
performs
actions
other
than
those
the
application
intended
.
SQL
Injection
results
from
failure
of
the
application
to
appropriately
validate
input
.
When
specially
crafted
user-controlled
input
consisting
of
SQL
syntax
is
used
without
proper
validation
as
part
of
SQL
queries
,
it
is
possible
to
glean
information
from
the
database
in
ways
not
envisaged
during
application
design
.
Depending
upon
the
database
and
the
design
of
the
application
,
it
may
also
be
possible
to
leverage
injection
to
have
the
database
execute
system-related
commands
of
the
attackers
'
choice
.
SQL
Injection
enables
an
attacker
to
talk
directly
to
the
database
,
thus
bypassing
the
application
completely
.
Successful
injection
can
cause
information
disclosure
as
well
as
ability
to
add
or
modify
data
in
the
database
.
In
order
to
successfully
inject
SQL
and
retrieve
information
from
a
database
,
an
attacker
