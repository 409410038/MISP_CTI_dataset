Since
the
start
of
the
Russo-Ukrainian
conflict
,
Kaspersky
researchers
and
the
international
community
at
large
have
identified
a
significant
number
of
cyberattacks
executed
in
a
political
and
geopolitical
context
.
We
previously
published
an
overview
of
cyber
activities
and
the
threat
landscape
related
to
the
conflict
between
Russia
and
Ukraine
and
continue
to
monitor
new
threats
in
these
regions
.
In
October
2022
,
we
identified
an
active
infection
of
government
,
agriculture
and
transportation
organizations
located
in
the
Donetsk
,
Lugansk
,
and
Crimea
regions
.
Although
the
initial
vector
of
compromise
is
unclear
,
the
details
of
the
next
stage
imply
the
use
of
spear
phishing
or
similar
methods
.
The
victims
navigated
to
a
URL
pointing
to
a
ZIP
archive
hosted
on
a
malicious
web
server
.
