An
authenticated
user
with
access
to
the
Strapi
admin
panel
can
view
private
and
sensitive
data
,
such
as
email
and
password
reset
tokens
,
for
other
admin
panel
users
that
have
a
relationship
(
e.g.
,
created
by
,
updated
by
)
with
content
accessible
to
the
authenticated
user
.
For
example
,
a
low-privileged
&
#
8220
;
author
&
#
8221
;
role
account
can
view
these
details
in
the
JSON
response
for
an
&
#
8220
;
editor
&
#
8221
;
or
&
#
8220
;
super
admin
&
#
8221
;
that
has
updated
one
of
the
author
&
#
8217
;
s
blog
posts
.
There
are
also
many
other
scenarios
where
such
details
from
other
users
can
leak
in
the
JSON
response
,
either
through
a
direct
or
indirect
relationship
.
Access
to
this
information
enables
a
user
to
compromise
other
users
&
#
8217
;
accounts
by
successfully
invoking
the
password
reset
workflow
.
In
a
worst-case
scenario
,
a
low-privileged
user
could
get
access
to
a
&
#
8220
;
super
admin
&
#
8221
;
account
with
full
control
over
the
Strapi
instance
,
and
could
read
and
modify
any
data
as
well
as
block
access
to
both
the
admin
panel
and
API
by
revoking
privileges
for
all
other
users
.
