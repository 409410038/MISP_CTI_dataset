Some
APIs
will
strip
certain
leading
characters
from
a
string
of
parameters
.
An
adversary
can
intentionally
introduce
leading
``
ghost
''
characters
(
extra
characters
that
do
n't
affect
the
validity
of
the
request
at
the
API
layer
)
that
enable
the
input
to
pass
the
filters
and
therefore
process
the
adversary
's
input
.
This
occurs
when
the
targeted
API
will
accept
input
data
in
several
syntactic
forms
and
interpret
it
in
the
equivalent
semantic
way
,
while
the
filter
does
not
take
into
account
the
full
spectrum
of
the
syntactic
forms
acceptable
to
the
targeted
API
.
