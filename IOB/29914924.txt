Identity
Spoofing
refers
to
the
action
of
assuming
(
i.e.
,
taking
on
)
the
identity
of
some
other
entity
(
human
or
non-human
)
and
then
using
that
identity
to
accomplish
a
goal
.
An
adversary
may
craft
messages
that
appear
to
come
from
a
different
principle
or
use
stolen
/
spoofed
authentication
credentials
.
Alternatively
,
an
adversary
may
intercept
a
message
from
a
legitimate
sender
and
attempt
to
make
it
look
like
the
message
comes
from
them
without
changing
its
content
.
The
latter
form
of
this
attack
can
be
used
to
hijack
credentials
from
legitimate
users
.
Identity
Spoofing
attacks
need
not
be
limited
to
transmitted
messages
-
any
resource
that
is
associated
with
an
identity
(
for
example
,
a
file
with
a
signature
)
can
be
the
target
of
an
attack
where
the
adversary
attempts
to
change
the
apparent
identity
.
This
attack
differs
from
Content
Spoofing
attacks
where
the
adversary
does
not
wish
to
change
the
apparent
identity
of
the
message
but
instead
wishes
to
change
what
the
message
says
.
In
an
Identity
Spoofing
attack
,
the
adversary
is
attempting
to
change
the
identity
of
the
content
.
