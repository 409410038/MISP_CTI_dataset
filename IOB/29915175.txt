An
attacker
modifies
the
parameters
of
the
SOAP
message
that
is
sent
from
the
service
consumer
to
the
service
provider
to
initiate
a
SQL
injection
attack
.
On
the
service
provider
side
,
the
SOAP
message
is
parsed
and
parameters
are
not
properly
validated
before
being
used
to
access
a
database
in
a
way
that
does
not
use
parameter
binding
,
thus
enabling
the
attacker
to
control
the
structure
of
the
executed
SQL
query
.
This
pattern
describes
a
SQL
injection
attack
with
the
delivery
mechanism
being
a
SOAP
message
.
