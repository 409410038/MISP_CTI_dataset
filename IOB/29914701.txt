An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
a
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
in
the
handling
of
binary
resources
.
Binary
resources
may
include
music
files
like
MP3
,
image
files
like
JPEG
files
,
and
any
other
binary
file
.
These
attacks
may
pass
unnoticed
to
the
client
machine
through
normal
usage
of
files
,
such
as
a
browser
loading
a
seemingly
innocent
JPEG
file
.
This
can
allow
the
attacker
access
to
the
execution
stack
and
execute
arbitrary
code
in
the
target
process
.
This
attack
pattern
is
a
variant
of
standard
buffer
overflow
attacks
using
an
unexpected
vector
(
binary
files
)
to
wrap
its
attack
and
open
up
a
new
attack
vector
.
The
attacker
is
required
to
either
directly
serve
the
binary
content
to
the
victim
,
or
place
it
in
a
locale
like
a
MP3
sharing
application
,
for
the
victim
to
download
.
The
attacker
then
is
notified
upon
the
download
or
otherwise
locates
the
vulnerability
opened
up
by
the
buffer
overflow
.
