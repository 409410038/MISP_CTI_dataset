In
this
blog
post
,
the
KrakenLabs
team
will
take
a
deep
dive
into
a
malware
sample
classified
as
LummaC2
,
an
information
stealer
written
in
C
language
that
has
been
sold
in
underground
forums
since
December
2022
.
We
assess
LummaC2
¡¦
s
primary
workflow
,
its
different
obfuscation
techniques
(
like
Windows
API
hashing
and
encoded
strings
)
and
how
to
overcome
them
to
effectively
analyze
the
malware
with
ease
.
There
is
a
huge
spike
in
the
popularity
and
use
of
information-stealing
malware
in
underground
markets
.
With
more
stealing
capabilities
,
simplified
administration
,
and
ability
to
remain
undetected
,
stealers
are
available
to
anyone
with
basic
computer
knowledge
.
