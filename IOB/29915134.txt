Strong
input
validation
-
All
user-controllable
input
must
be
validated
and
filtered
for
illegal
characters
as
well
as
content
that
can
be
interpreted
in
the
context
of
an
XPath
expression
.
Characters
such
as
a
single-quote
(
'
)
or
operators
such
as
or
(
|
)
,
and
(
&
)
and
such
should
be
filtered
if
the
application
does
not
expect
them
in
the
context
in
which
they
appear
.
If
such
content
can
not
be
filtered
,
it
must
at
least
be
properly
escaped
to
avoid
them
being
interpreted
as
part
of
XPath
expressions
.
Use
of
parameterized
XPath
queries
-
Parameterization
causes
the
input
to
be
restricted
to
certain
domains
,
such
as
strings
or
integers
,
and
any
input
outside
such
domains
is
considered
invalid
and
the
query
fails
.
Use
of
custom
error
pages
-
Attackers
can
glean
information
about
the
nature
of
queries
from
descriptive
error
messages
.
Input
validation
must
be
coupled
with
customized
error
pages
that
inform
about
an
error
without
disclosing
information
about
the
database
or
application
.
