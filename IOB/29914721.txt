Use
a
language
or
compiler
that
performs
automatic
bounds
checking
.
Use
secure
functions
not
vulnerable
to
buffer
overflow
.
If
you
have
to
use
dangerous
functions
,
make
sure
that
you
do
boundary
checking
.
Compiler-based
canary
mechanisms
such
as
StackGuard
,
ProPolice
and
the
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
/GS
flag
.
Unless
this
provides
automatic
bounds
checking
,
it
is
not
a
complete
solution
.
Use
OS-level
preventative
functionality
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
Utilize
static
source
code
analysis
tools
to
identify
potential
buffer
overflow
weaknesses
in
the
software
.
