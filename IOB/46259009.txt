The
Amadey
bot
is
a
Trojan
that
was
first
discovered
in
2018
and
is
used
to
steal
sensitive
information
from
the
infected
device
.
Initially
,
it
was
found
to
be
distributed
through
exploit
kits
,
and
Threat
Actors
(
TAs
)
utilized
it
to
deploy
other
malware
,
such
as
the
GrandCrab
ransomware
and
the
Flawed
Ammyy
Remote
Access
Trojan
.
In
2022
,
the
Amadey
bot
was
used
by
affiliates
of
LOCKBIT
to
spread
ransomware
to
the
victims
.
Recently
,
Cyble
Research
and
Intelligence
Labs
(
CRIL
)
has
detected
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
Amadey
bot
samples
,
indicating
that
threat
actors
are
actively
utilizing
this
bot
to
infect
victims
¡¦
systems
with
additional
malware
.
The

below
depict
the

in

The
Amadey

malware
creates
a
copy
of
itself
in
a
random

location
and
executes
it
using
the

API
.
%
TEMP
%
\4b9a106e76\nbveek.exe
After
this
,
the
Amadey
bot
creates
a
Mutex
named
¡§

¡¨
to
ensure
that
only
one
instance
of
malware
is
running
at
any
given
time
on
the
infected
system
.
Persistence
The
malware
establishes
persistence
by
adding
a
¡§
startup
¡¨
value
in
the
below
registry
key
.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User
Shell
Folders
.
The

¡§

¡¨
contains
the
path
of
the
Amadey

that
was
dropped
in
the

Using
this
technique
,
the

executes
whenever
a
user
logs
in
.

Main
The
¡§
Clip64.dll
¡¨
is
a
Clipper
module
that
intercepts
cryptocurrency
transactions
by
replacing
a
victim
¡¦
s
intended
recipient
with
the
attacker
¡¦
s
wallet
address
.
It
does
this
by
monitoring
the
clipboard
of
the
victim
¡¦
s
computer
and
swapping
any
copied
cryptocurrency
wallet
addresses
with
the
TA
¡¦
s
address
.
This
results
in
the
victim
unknowingly
sending
their
funds
to
the
attacker
instead
of
the
intended
recipient
.
When
the
Clipper
module
runs
,
it
retrieves
the
value
stored
in
the
clipboard
of
the
victims
by
utilizing
the
GetClipBoardData
(
)
API
function
,
as
shown
below
.
Figure
12
¡V
GetClipBoardData
(
)
function
Then
,
the
malware
checks
the
data
in
the
clipboard
to
see
if
it
contains
a
cryptocurrency
wallet
address
by
evaluating
it
based
on
certain
conditions
,
such
as
the
length
and
starting
character
of
the
string
.
If
a
wallet
address
is
detected
,
the
malware
uses
the
OpenClipBoard
(
)
,
EmptyClipBoard
(
)
,
and
SetClipBoard
(
)
functions
to
replace
the
legitimate
wallet
address
with
the
attacker

s
address
,

also
identified
that
the
Amadey

is
responsible

malware
families
,
such
as

,

,

.
Conclusion
In
recent
years
,
the
design
and
capabilities
of
bots
have
advanced
significantly
.
A
bot
like
Amadey
is
fully
equipped
with
features
such
as
system
reconnaissance
,
information
stealing
,
downloading
&
executing
other
malware
,
data
exfiltration
,
and
even
clipper
functionalities
in
its
latest
version
.
This
allows
Threat
Actors
to
steal
personal
,
financial
,
and
login
information
stored
in
web
browsers
,
which
can
then
be
used
for
various
fraudulent
activities
.
This
type
of
malware
¡¦
s
wide
range
of
capabilities
makes
them
a
significant
threat
to
a
broad
range
of
potential
victims
.
Cyble
Research
and
Intelligence
Labs
will
continue
monitoring
the
latest
phishing
or
malware
strains
in
the
wild
and
update
blogs
with
actionable
intelligence
to
protect
users
from
such
notorious
attacks
.
Our
Recommendations
The
initial
infection
may
happen
via
phishing
websites
,
so
enterprises
should
use
security
products
to
detect
phishing
websites
.
Avoid
downloading
pirated
software
from
Warez/Torrent
websites
.
The
¡§
Hack
Tool
¡¨
present
on
sites
such
as
YouTube
,
Torrent
sites
,
etc.
,
contains
such
malware
.
Use
strong
passwords
and
enforce
multi-factor
authentication
wherever
possible
.
Turn
on
the
automatic
software
update
feature
on
your
computer
,
mobile
,
and
other
connected
devices
.
Use
a
reputed
antivirus
and
internet
security
software
package
on
your
connected
devices
,
including
PC
,
laptop
,
and
mobile
.
Refrain
from
opening
untrusted
links
and
email
attachments
without
first
verifying
their
authenticity
.
Educate
employees
on
protecting
themselves
from
threats
like
phishing/untrusted
URLs
.
Block
URLs
that
could
be
used
to
spread
the
malware
,
e.g.
,
Torrent/Warez
.
Monitor
the
beacon
on
the
network
level
to
block
data
exfiltration
by
malware
or
TAs
.
Users
should
also
carefully
check
their
wallet
addresses
before
making
any
cryptocurrency
transaction
to
ensure
there
is
no
change
when
copying
and
pasting
the
actual
wallet
addresses
.
