In
circumstances
where
an
application
holds
important
data
client-side
in
tokens
(
cookies
,
URLs
,
data
files
,
and
so
forth
)
that
data
can
be
manipulated
.
If
client
or
server-side
application
components
reinterpret
that
data
as
authentication
tokens
or
data
(
such
as
store
item
pricing
or
wallet
information
)
then
even
opaquely
manipulating
that
data
may
bear
fruit
for
an
Attacker
.
In
this
pattern
an
attacker
undermines
the
assumption
that
client
side
tokens
have
been
adequately
protected
from
tampering
through
use
of
encryption
or
obfuscation
.
