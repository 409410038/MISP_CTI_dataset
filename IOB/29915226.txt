Strong
input
validation
-
All
user-controllable
input
must
be
validated
and
filtered
for
illegal
characters
as
well
as
SQL
content
.
Keywords
such
as
UNION
,
SELECT
or
INSERT
must
be
filtered
in
addition
to
characters
such
as
a
single-quote
(
'
)
or
SQL-comments
(
--
)
based
on
the
context
in
which
they
appear
.
Use
of
parameterized
queries
or
stored
procedures
-
Parameterization
causes
the
input
to
be
restricted
to
certain
domains
,
such
as
strings
or
integers
,
and
any
input
outside
such
domains
is
considered
invalid
and
the
query
fails
.
Note
that
SQL
Injection
is
possible
even
in
the
presence
of
stored
procedures
if
the
eventual
query
is
constructed
dynamically
.
Use
of
custom
error
pages
-
Attackers
can
glean
information
about
the
nature
of
queries
from
descriptive
error
messages
.
Input
validation
must
be
coupled
with
customized
error
pages
that
inform
about
an
error
without
disclosing
information
about
the
database
or
application
.
