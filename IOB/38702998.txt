The
lack
of
validation
of
a
key-value
field
in
the
Splunk-to-Splunk
protocol
results
in
a
denial-of-service
in
Splunk
Enterprise
instances
configured
to
index
Universal
Forwarder
traffic
.
See
https
:
//docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Forwarding/Enableareceiver
for
more
information
on
configuring
an
indexer
to
listen
for
UF
traffic
.
It
does
not
impact
Universal
Forwarders
.
When
Splunk
forwarding
is
secured
using
TLS
or
a
Token
,
the
attack
requires
compromising
the
certificate
or
token
,
or
both
.
As
a
partial
mitigation
and
a
security
best
practice
,
see
https
:
//docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/ConfigureSplunkforwardingtousesignedcertificates
and
https
:
//docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/latest/Forwarder/Controlforwarderaccess
.
Implementation
of
either
or
both
reduces
the
severity
to
Medium
.
