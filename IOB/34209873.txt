The
Microsoft
Threat
Intelligence
Center
(
MSTIC
)
has
observed
and
taken
actions
to
disrupt
campaigns
launched
by
SEABORGIUM
,
an
actor
Microsoft
has
tracked
since
2017
.
SEABORGIUM
is
a
threat
actor
that
originates
from
Russia
,
with
objectives
and
victimology
that
align
closely
with
Russian
state
interests
.
Its
campaigns
involve
persistent
phishing
and
credential
theft
campaigns
leading
to
intrusions
and
data
theft
.
SEABORGIUM
intrusions
have
also
been
linked
to
hack-and-leak
campaigns
,
where
stolen
and
leaked
data
is
used
to
shape
narratives
in
targeted
countries
.
While
we
can
not
rule
out
that
supporting
elements
of
the
group
may
have
current
or
prior
affiliations
with
criminal
or
other
nonstate
ecosystems
,
MSTIC
assesses
that
information
collected
during
SEABORGIUM
intrusions
likely
supports
traditional
espionage
objectives
and
information
operations
as
opposed
to
financial
motivations
.
This
blog
provides
insights
into
SEABORGIUM
・
s
activities
and
technical
methods
,
with
the
goal
of
sharing
context
and
raising
awareness
about
a
significant
threat
to
Microsoft
customers
.
MSTIC
would
like
to
acknowledge
the
Google
Threat
Analysis
Group
(
TAG
)
and
the
Proofpoint
Threat
Research
Team
for
their
collaboration
on
tracking
and
disrupting
this
actor
.
Microsoft
・
s
ability
to
detect
and
track
SEABORGIUM
・
s
abuse
of
Microsoft
services
,
particularly
OneDrive
,
has
provided
MSTIC
sustained
visibility
into
the
actor
・
s
activities
and
enabled
us
to
notify
impacted
customers
.
As
an
outcome
of
these
service
abuse
investigations
,
MSTIC
partnered
with
abuse
teams
in
Microsoft
to
disable
accounts
used
by
the
actor
for
reconnaissance
,
phishing
,
and
email
collection
.
Microsoft
Defender
SmartScreen
has
also
implemented
detections
against
the
phishing
domains
represented
in
SEABORGIUM
・
s
activities
