OpenShift
does
n't
properly
verify
subdomain
ownership
,
which
allows
route
takeover
.
Once
a
custom
route
is
created
,
the
user
must
update
the
DNS
provider
by
creating
a
canonical
name
(
CNAME
)
record
(
if
he
likes
to
expose
this
route
externally
)
.
The
CNAME
record
should
point
the
custom
domain
to
the
OpenShift
router
as
the
alias
.
In
a
case
that
the
CNAME
is
not
removed
when
the
route
is
not
in
use
anymore
we
are
dealing
with
a
dangling
route
.
A
malicious
actor
may
take
over
the
route
.
