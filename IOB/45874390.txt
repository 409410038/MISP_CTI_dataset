The
BackupWordPress
plugin
for
WordPress
is
vulnerable
to
information
disclosure
in
versions
up
to
,
and
including
3.12
.
This
is
due
to
missing
authorization
on
the
heartbeat_received
(
)
function
that
triggers
on
WordPress
heartbeat
.
This
makes
it
possible
for
authenticated
attackers
,
with
subscriber-level
permissions
and
above
to
retrieve
back-up
paths
that
can
subsequently
be
used
to
download
the
back-up
.
