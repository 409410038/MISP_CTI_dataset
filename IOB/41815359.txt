Octocat.js
is
a
library
used
to
render
a
set
of
options
into
an
SVG
.
Versions
prior
to
1.2
are
subject
to
JavaScript
injection
via
user
provided
URLs
.
Users
can
include
their
own
images
for
accessories
via
provided
URLs
.
These
URLs
are
not
validated
and
can
result
in
execution
of
injected
code
.
This
vulnerability
was
fixed
in
version
1.2
of
octocat.js
.
As
a
workaround
,
writing
an
image
to
disk
then
using
that
image
in
an
image
element
in
HTML
mitigates
the
risk
.
