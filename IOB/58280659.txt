While
monitoring
the
network
traffic
of
our
own
corporate
Wi-Fi
network
dedicated
for
mobile
devices
using
the
Kaspersky
Unified
Monitoring
and
Analysis
Platform
(
KUMA
)
,
we
noticed
suspicious
activity
that
originated
from
several
iOS-based
phones
.
Since
it
is
impossible
to
inspect
modern
iOS
devices
from
the
inside
,
we
created
offline
backups
of
the
devices
in
question
,
inspected
them
using
the
Mobile
Verification
Toolkit
¡¦
s
mvt-ios
and
discovered
traces
of
compromise
.
We
are
calling
this
campaign
¡§
Operation
Triangulation
¡¨
,
and
all
the
related
information
we
have
on
it
will
be
collected
on
the
Operation
Triangulation
page
.
If
you
