This
type
of
attack
leverages
the
use
of
symbolic
links
to
cause
buffer
overflows
.
An
attacker
can
try
to
create
or
manipulate
a
symbolic
link
file
such
that
its
contents
result
in
out
of
bounds
data
.
When
the
target
software
processes
the
symbolic
link
file
,
it
could
potentially
overflow
internal
buffers
with
insufficient
bounds
checking
.
