An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
a
system
's
configuration
that
allows
an
attacker
to
either
directly
access
an
executable
file
,
for
example
through
shell
access
;
or
in
a
possible
worst
case
allows
an
attacker
to
upload
a
file
and
then
execute
it
.
Web
servers
,
ftp
servers
,
and
message
oriented
middleware
systems
which
have
many
integration
points
are
particularly
vulnerable
,
because
both
the
programmers
and
the
administrators
must
be
in
synch
regarding
the
interfaces
and
the
correct
privileges
for
each
interface
.
