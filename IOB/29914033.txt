The
target
must
be
misconfigured
to
return
a
list
of
a
directory's
content
when
it
receives
a
request
that
ends
in
a
directory
name
rather
than
a
file
name
.
The
adversary
must
be
able
to
control
the
path
that
is
requested
of
the
target
.
The
administrator
must
have
failed
to
properly
configure
an
ACL
or
has
associated
an
overly
permissive
ACL
with
a
particular
directory
.
The
server
version
or
patch
level
must
not
inherently
prevent
known
directory
listing
attacks
from
working
.
