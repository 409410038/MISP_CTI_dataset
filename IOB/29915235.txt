An
attacker
manipulates
or
crafts
an
LDAP
query
for
the
purpose
of
undermining
the
security
of
the
target
.
Some
applications
use
user
input
to
create
LDAP
queries
that
are
processed
by
an
LDAP
server
.
For
example
,
a
user
might
provide
their
username
during
authentication
and
the
username
might
be
inserted
in
an
LDAP
query
during
the
authentication
process
.
An
attacker
could
use
this
input
to
inject
additional
commands
into
an
LDAP
query
that
could
disclose
sensitive
information
.
For
example
,
entering
a
*
in
the
aforementioned
query
might
return
information
about
all
users
on
the
system
.
This
attack
is
very
similar
to
an
SQL
injection
attack
in
that
it
manipulates
a
query
to
gather
additional
information
or
coerce
a
particular
return
value
.
