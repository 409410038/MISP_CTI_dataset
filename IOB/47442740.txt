Intezer
has
been
tracking
activity
targeting
the
energy
sector
and
noted
a
campaign
with
techniques
that
align
with
those
of
Bitter
APT
,
operating
in
the
Asia-Pacific
region
.
We
have
made
the
connection
to
Bitter
APT
through
tactics
,
techniques
,
and
procedures
(
TTPs
)
that
have
been
observed
in
other
publications
,
such
as
the
use
of
Microsoft
Office
exploits
through
Excel
files
,
and
the
use
of
CHM
and
Windows
Installer
(
MSI
)
files
.
Bitter
APT
is
a
South
Asian
threat
group
that
commonly
targets
energy
and
government
sectors
;
they
have
been
known
to
target
Pakistan
,
China
,
Bangladesh
,
and
Saudi
Arabia
.
Bitter
APT
are
continuing
to
target
organizations
in
China
in
an
espionage
campaign
,
as
our
here
research
shows
.
For
some
of
the
payloads
we
have
corresponding
phishing
emails
that
were
used
as
lures
to
deliver
the
files
,
allowing
analysis
of
the
social
engineering
techniques
used
.
We
have
noted
updates
to
the
first-stage
payloads
used
,
with
new
layers
of
obfuscation
to
hinder
analysis
and
additional
decoys
used
for
social
engineering
.
