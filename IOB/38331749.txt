io_uring
uses
work_flags
to
determine
which
identity
need
to
grab
from
the
calling
process
to
make
sure
it
is
consistent
with
the
calling
process
when
executing
IORING_OP
.
The
mapping
of
flags
is
incomplete
,
which
leads
to
multiple
incorrect
reference
counts
and
hence
use-after-free
.
We
recommend
upgrading
past
