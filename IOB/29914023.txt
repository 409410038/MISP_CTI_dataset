In
a
more
general
setting
,
the
administrator
must
mark
every
resource
besides
the
ones
supposed
to
be
exposed
to
the
user
as
accessible
by
a
role
impossible
for
the
user
to
assume
.
The
default
security
setting
must
be
to
deny
access
and
then
grant
access
only
to
those
resources
intended
by
business
logic
.
