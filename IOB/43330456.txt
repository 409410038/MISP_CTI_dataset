Using
long
exponents
in
the
Diffie-Hellman
Key
Agreement
Protocol
allows
remote
attackers
(
from
the
client
side
)
to
trigger
unnecessarily
expensive
server-side
DHE
modular-exponentiation
calculations
.
An
attacker
may
cause
asymmetric
resource
consumption
with
any
common
client
application
which
uses
a
DHE
implementation
that
applies
short
exponents
.
The
attack
may
be
more
disruptive
in
cases
where
a
client
sends
arbitrary
numbers
that
are
actually
not
DH
public
keys
(
aka
the
D
(
HE
)
ater
attack
)
or
can
require
a
server
to
select
its
largest
supported
key
size
.
The
basic
attack
scenario
is
that
the
client
must
claim
that
it
can
only
communicate
with
DHE
,
and
the
server
must
be
configured
to
allow
DHE
.
This
can
affect
TLS
,
SSH
,
and
IKE
.
