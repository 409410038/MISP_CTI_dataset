An
attacker
already
has
some
access
to
the
system
or
can
steal
the
client
based
data
tokens
from
another
user
who
has
access
to
the
system
.
For
an
Attacker
to
viably
execute
this
attack
,
some
data
(
later
interpreted
by
the
application
)
must
be
held
client-side
in
a
way
that
can
be
manipulated
without
detection
.
This
means
that
the
data
or
tokens
are
not
CRCd
as
part
of
their
value
or
through
a
separate
meta-data
store
elsewhere
.
