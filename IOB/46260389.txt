Recently
,
multiple
active
phishing
campaigns
have
been
targeting
Belgian
organizations
.
The
campaigns
use
similar
tactics
,
i.e
.
compromising
an
email
account
to
send
out
phishing
emails
to
their
business
contacts
.
The
phishing
emails
contain
a
link
,
which
brings
the
victim
to
a
webpage
with
a
PDF
or
OneNote
document
.
To
view
the
document
,
the
victim
clicks
on
another
link
that
starts
a
fake
login
page
,
prompting
the
victim
to
enter
their
credentials
