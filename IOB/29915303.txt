An
attacker
can
use
Server
Side
Include
(
SSI
)
Injection
to
send
code
to
a
web
application
that
then
gets
executed
by
the
web
server
.
Doing
so
enables
the
attacker
to
achieve
similar
results
to
Cross
Site
Scripting
,
viz.
,
arbitrary
code
execution
and
information
disclosure
,
albeit
on
a
more
limited
scale
,
since
the
SSI
directives
are
nowhere
near
as
powerful
as
a
full-fledged
scripting
language
.
Nonetheless
,
the
attacker
can
conveniently
gain
access
to
sensitive
files
,
such
as
password
files
,
and
execute
shell
commands
.
