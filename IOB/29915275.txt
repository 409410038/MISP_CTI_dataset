An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
the
host
's
trust
in
executing
remote
content
,
including
binary
files
.
The
files
are
poisoned
with
a
malicious
payload
(
targeting
the
file
systems
accessible
by
the
target
software
)
by
the
adversary
and
may
be
passed
through
standard
channels
such
as
via
email
,
and
standard
web
content
like
PDF
and
multimedia
files
.
The
adversary
exploits
known
vulnerabilities
or
handling
routines
in
the
target
processes
.
Vulnerabilities
of
this
type
have
been
found
in
a
wide
variety
of
commercial
applications
from
Microsoft
Office
to
Adobe
Acrobat
and
Apple
Safari
web
browser
.
When
the
adversary
knows
the
standard
handling
routines
and
can
identify
vulnerabilities
and
entry
points
,
they
can
be
exploited
by
otherwise
seemingly
normal
content
.
Once
the
attack
is
executed
,
the
adversary
's
program
can
access
relative
directories
such
as
%
PROGRAMFILES
%
\or
other
standard
system
directories
to
launch
further
attacks
.
In
a
worst
case
scenario
,
these
programs
are
combined
with
other
propagation
logic
and
work
as
a
virus
.
