General
information
The
Government
Team
for
Responding
to
Computer
Emergency
Events
of
Ukraine
CERT-UA
to
the
Implementation
of
the
Law
of
Ukraine
``
On
the
Basic
Principles
of
Cyber
Security
of
Ukraine
''
takes
organizational
and
technical
measures
to
prevent
,
detecting
and
responding
to
cyber
incidents
and
cyberattacks
and
eliminating
their
consequences
.
According
to
the
fact
of
receiving
information
about
the
interference
in
the
information
and
communication
system
(
IX
)
of
one
of
the
state
organizations
of
Ukraine
,
measures
were
initiated
to
study
cyberattacks
.
It
is
found
that
the
performance
of
electronic
computing
machines
(
server
equipment
,
automated
user
jobs
,
storage
systems
)
was
disrupted
as
a
result
of
destructive
effects
with
the
use
of
appropriate
software
.
In
particular
,
RoarBat
-
BAT-script
,
used
to
disable
EOMs
operating
the
(
OC
)
Windows
operating
system
,
performing
recursive
file
search
(
on
disks
and
in
specific
directories
)
by
a
certain
list
of
extensions
(
.doc
,
.docx
,
.rtf
,
.txt
,
.xls
,
.xlsx
,
.ppt
,

,

,

,
.zip
,
.rar
,
.7z
,
.mp4
,
.sql
,
.php
,
.vbk
,
.vib
,
.vrb
,
.p7s
and
.sys
,
.dll
,
.exe
,
.bin
,
.dat
)
in
order
to
further
archive
them
using
the
legitimate
WinRAR
program
with
the
option
``
-df
''
,
which
provides
for
the
removal
of
the
source
file
,
as
well
as
further
removal
of
the
created
archives
.
The
launch
of
the
script
was
carried
out
using
a
planned
task
,
which
,
according
to
preliminary
information
,
was
created
and
centrally
distributed
by
group
policy
means
(
GPO
)
.
Disabling
the
EOM
running
Linux
was
done
using
a
BASH
script
,
which
,
among
other
things
,
provided
the
use
of
a
full-time
utility
``
dd
''
to
overwrite
files
with
zero
bytes
.
Access
to
the
IC
object
of
attack
is
presumably
obtained
by
connecting
to
a
VPN
using
compromised
authentication
data
.
The
method
of
implementing
a
malicious
idea
,
the
IP
addresses
of
the
access
entities
,
as
well
as
the
fact
of
using
a
modified
version
of
RoarBat
indicate
similarity
with
the
cyber
attack
on
Ukrinform
,
the
information
about
which
was
published
in
the
telegram
channel
``
CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn
''
17.01.2023
.
Thus
,
despite
the
coverage
of
the
fact
of
the
cyber
attack
with
the
help
of
another
telegram
channel
,
the
described
active
with
a
moderate
level
of
confidence
CERT-UA
associates
with
the
activities
of
the
Sandworm
group
,
however
,
an
appropriate
UAC-0165
identifier
has
been
created
for
its
point
tracking
.
We
note
that
the
successful
implementation
of
the
attack
was
facilitated
by
the
lack
of
multifactor
authentication
in
remote
VPN
connections
,
the
lack
of
network
segmentation
and
filtering
of
input
,
output
and
cross-segment
information
flows
.
Once
again
,
we
urge
responsible
employees
not
to
ignore
reports
of
signs
of
abnormal
activity
and
to
take
immediate
action
to
reduce
the
``
surface
''
attack
:
to
analyze
and
secure
the
``
external
''
perimeter
of
the
ICS
organization
(
to
capture
vulnerabilities
,
disable
services
,
restrict
access
to
control
interfaces
,
etc
.
)
,
provide
filtering
of
input
,
output
,
cross-segment
information
flows
on
the
principle
of
``
no
everything
that
is
clearly
not
allowed
''
and
introduce
the
use
of
multifactor
authentication
in
remote
access
to
ICS
(
VPN
)
and
/
or
corporate
services
such
as
e-mail
,
document
management
and
others
(
