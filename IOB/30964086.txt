This
module
is
a
Python
script
file
that
downloads
all
dependencies
and
compiles
the
malware
into
different
OS
architectures
including
x86
,
ARM
,
macOS
,
OpenBSD
,
PowerPC
,
MIPS
,
and
more
.
Once

is
complete
,
the
script
then
creates
a
batch
file
¡¥
update.sh
¡¦
which
is
used
by
the
bot
as
a
downloader
that
is
then
delivered
to
any
identified
vulnerable
targets
to
spread
the
malware
.
