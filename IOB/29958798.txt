By
the
beginning
of
March
2022
,
the
CERT-UA
response
team
of
Ukraine
detected
several
RAR-archives
with
the
names
``
Assistance.rar
''
,
``
Necessary_military_assistance.rar
''
.
Each
of
these
archives
contained
the
scandalous
files
with
the
names
``
List
of
necessary
things
for
the
provision
of
military
humanitarian
assistance
to
Ukraine.lnk
''
,
``
Providing
military
humanitarian
assistance
to
Ukraine.lnk
''
.
In
addition
,
it
is
also
clear
that
the
method
of
delivery
was
electronic
sheets
referring
to
the
mentioned
RAR-archives
.
The
use
of
the
English
language
in
the
names
of
the
files
and
the
text
of
the
electronic
sheet
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
sheet
was
sent
to
the
address
of
the
Latvian
state
authority
,
unequivocally
indicates
that
the
UAC-0010
(
Armageddon
)
group
attacked
the
state
organizations
of
the
European
Union
countries
.
