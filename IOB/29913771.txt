This
attack
targets
the
encoding
of
the
URL
combined
with
the
encoding
of
the
slash
characters
.
An
attacker
can
take
advantage
of
the
multiple
ways
of
encoding
a
URL
and
abuse
the
interpretation
of
the
URL
.
A
URL
may
contain
special
character
that
need
special
syntax
handling
in
order
to
be
interpreted
.
Special
characters
are
represented
using
a
percentage
character
followed
by
two
digits
representing
the
octet
code
of
the
original
character
(
%
HEX-CODE
)
.
For
instance
US-ASCII
space
character
would
be
represented
with
%
20
.
This
is
often
referred
as
escaped
ending
or
percent-encoding
.
Since
the
server
decodes
the
URL
from
the
requests
,
it
may
restrict
the
access
to
some
URL
paths
by
validating
and
filtering
out
the
URL
requests
it
received
.
An
attacker
will
try
to
craft
an
URL
with
a
sequence
of
special
characters
which
once
interpreted
by
the
server
will
be
equivalent
to
a
forbidden
URL
.
It
can
be
difficult
to
protect
against
this
attack
since
the
URL
can
contain
other
format
of
encoding
such
as
UTF-8
encoding
,
Unicode-encoding
,
etc
.
