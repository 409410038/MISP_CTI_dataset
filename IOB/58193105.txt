In
April
,
FortiGuard
Labs
observed
a
unique
botnet
based
on
the
SOCKS
protocol
distributed
through
the
Ruckus
vulnerability
(
CVE-2023-25717
)
.
This
botnet
,
known
as
AndoryuBot
,
first
appeared
in
February
2023
.
It
contains
DDoS
attack
modules
for
different
protocols
and
communicates
with
its
command-and-control
server
using
SOCKS5
proxies
.
Based
on
our
IPS
signatures
trigger
count
(
Figure
1
)
,
this
campaign
started
distributing
the
current
version
sometime
after
mid-April
.
This
article
details
how
this
malware
leverages
the
Ruckus
vulnerability
and
examines
its
behavior
once
inside
an
infected
device
.
CVE-2023-25717
is
a
remote
code
execution
vulnerability
affecting
multiple
Ruckus
wireless
Access
Point
(
AP
)
devices
(
FortiGuard
Labs
released
a
threat
signal
report
about
CVE-2023-25717
on
April
28
)
.
Once
a
target
device
is
compromised
,
AndoryuBot
quickly
spreads
and
begins
communicating
with
its
C2
server
via
the
SOCKS
protocol
.
In
a
very
short
time
,
it
is
updated
with
additional
DDoS
methods
and
awaits
attack
commands
.
Users
should
be
aware
of
this
new
threat
and
actively
apply
patches
on
affected
devices
as
soon
as
they
become
available
.
