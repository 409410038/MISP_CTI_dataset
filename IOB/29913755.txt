Design
:
Enforce
principle
of
least
privilege
.
Design
:
Ensure
all
input
is
validated
,
and
does
not
contain
file
system
commands
Design
:
Run
server
interfaces
with
a
non-root
account
and/or
utilize
chroot
jails
or
other
configuration
techniques
to
constrain
privileges
even
if
attacker
gains
some
limited
access
to
commands
.
Design
:
For
interactive
user
applications
,
consider
if
direct
file
system
interface
is
necessary
,
instead
consider
having
the
application
proxy
communication
.
Implementation
:
Perform
testing
such
as
pen-testing
and
vulnerability
scanning
to
identify
directories
,
programs
,
and
interfaces
that
grant
direct
access
to
executables
.
