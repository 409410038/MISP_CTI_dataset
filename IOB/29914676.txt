Carefully
review
the
service
's
implementation
before
making
it
available
to
user
.
For
instance
you
can
use
manual
or
automated
code
review
to
uncover
vulnerabilities
such
as
buffer
overflow
.
Use
a
language
or
compiler
that
performs
automatic
bounds
checking
.
Use
an
abstraction
library
to
abstract
away
risky
APIs
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
Compiler-based
canary
mechanisms
such
as
StackGuard
,
ProPolice
and
the
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
/GS
flag
.
Unless
this
provides
automatic
bounds
checking
,
it
is
not
a
complete
solution
.
Operational
:
Use
OS-level
preventative
functionality
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
Apply
the
latest
patches
to
your
user
exposed
services
.
This
may
not
be
a
complete
solution
,
especially
against
a
zero
day
attack
.
Do
not
unnecessarily
expose
services
.
