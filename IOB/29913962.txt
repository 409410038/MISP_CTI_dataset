SOA
and
Web
Services
often
use
a
registry
to
perform
look
up
,
get
schema
information
,
and
metadata
about
services
.
A
poisoned
registry
can
redirect
(
think
phishing
for
servers
)
the
service
requester
to
a
malicious
service
provider
,
provide
incorrect
information
in
schema
or
metadata
(
to
effect
a
denial
of
service
)
,
and
delete
information
about
service
provider
interfaces
.
WS-Addressing
is
used
to
virtualize
services
,
provide
return
addresses
and
other
routing
information
,
however
,
unless
the
WS-Addressing
headers
are
protected
they
are
vulnerable
to
rewriting
.
The
attacker
that
can
rewrite
WS-addressing
information
gains
the
ability
to
route
service
requesters
to
any
service
providers
,
and
the
ability
to
route
service
provider
response
to
any
service
.
Content
in
a
registry
is
deployed
by
the
service
provider
.
The
registry
in
an
SOA
or
Web
Services
system
can
be
accessed
by
the
service
requester
via
UDDI
or
other
protocol
.
The
basic
flow
for
the
attacker
consists
of
either
altering
the
data
at
rest
in
the
registry
or
uploading
malicious
content
by
spoofing
a
service
provider
.
The
service
requester
is
then
redirected
to
send
its
requests
and/or
responses
to
services
the
attacker
controls
.
