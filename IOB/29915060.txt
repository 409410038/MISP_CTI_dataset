Blind
SQL
Injection
results
from
an
insufficient
mitigation
for
SQL
Injection
.
Although
suppressing
database
error
messages
are
considered
best
practice
,
the
suppression
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
prevent
SQL
Injection
.
Blind
SQL
Injection
is
a
form
of
SQL
Injection
that
overcomes
the
lack
of
error
messages
.
Without
the
error
messages
that
facilitate
SQL
Injection
,
the
adversary
constructs
input
strings
that
probe
the
target
through
simple
Boolean
SQL
expressions
.
The
adversary
can
determine
if
the
syntax
and
structure
of
the
injection
was
successful
based
on
whether
the
query
was
executed
or
not
.
Applied
iteratively
,
the
adversary
determines
how
and
where
the
target
is
vulnerable
to
SQL
Injection
.
