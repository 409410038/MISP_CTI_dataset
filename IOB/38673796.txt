In
Python
(
aka
CPython
)
through
3.10.4
,
the
mailcap
module
does
not
add
escape
characters
into
commands
discovered
in
the
system
mailcap
file
.
This
may
allow
attackers
to
inject
shell
commands
into
applications
that
call
mailcap.findmatch
with
untrusted
input
(
if
they
lack
validation
of
user-provided
filenames
or
arguments
)
.
