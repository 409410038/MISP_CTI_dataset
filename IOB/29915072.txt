If
a
string
is
passed
through
a
filter
of
some
kind
,
then
a
terminal
NULL
may
not
be
valid
.
Using
alternate
representation
of
NULL
allows
an
attacker
to
embed
the
NULL
mid-string
while
postfixing
the
proper
data
so
that
the
filter
is
avoided
.
One
example
is
a
filter
that
looks
for
a
trailing
slash
character
.
If
a
string
insertion
is
possible
,
but
the
slash
must
exist
,
an
alternate
encoding
of
NULL
in
mid-string
may
be
used
.
