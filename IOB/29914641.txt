An
adversary
manipulates
an
application
's
interaction
with
a
buffer
in
an
attempt
to
read
or
modify
data
they
should
n't
have
access
to
.
Buffer
attacks
are
distinguished
in
that
it
is
the
buffer
space
itself
that
is
the
target
of
the
attack
rather
than
any
code
responsible
for
interpreting
the
content
of
the
buffer
.
In
virtually
all
buffer
attacks
the
content
that
is
placed
in
the
buffer
is
immaterial
.
Instead
,
most
buffer
attacks
involve
retrieving
or
providing
more
input
than
can
be
stored
in
the
allocated
buffer
,
resulting
in
the
reading
or
overwriting
of
other
unintended
program
memory
.
