Design
:
Enforce
principle
of
least
privilege
Design
:
Validate
all
input
for
content
including
files
.
Ensure
that
if
files
and
remote
content
must
be
accepted
that
once
accepted
,
they
are
placed
in
a
sandbox
type
location
so
that
lower
assurance
clients
can
not
write
up
to
higher
assurance
processes
(
like
Web
server
processes
for
example
)
Design
:
Execute
programs
with
constrained
privileges
,
so
parent
process
does
not
open
up
further
vulnerabilities
.
Ensure
that
all
directories
,
temporary
directories
and
files
,
and
memory
are
executing
with
limited
privileges
to
protect
against
remote
execution
.
Design
:
Proxy
communication
to
host
,
so
that
communications
are
terminated
at
the
proxy
,
sanitizing
the
requests
before
forwarding
to
server
host
.
Implementation
:
Virus
scanning
on
host
Implementation
:
Host
integrity
monitoring
for
critical
files
,
directories
,
and
processes
.
The
goal
of
host
integrity
monitoring
is
to
be
aware
when
a
security
issue
has
occurred
so
that
incident
response
and
other
forensic
activities
can
begin
.
