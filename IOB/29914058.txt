This
attack
targets
user
controlled
variables
(
DEBUG=1
,
PHP
Globals
,
and
So
Forth
)
.
An
attacker
can
override
environment
variables
leveraging
user-supplied
,
untrusted
query
variables
directly
used
on
the
application
server
without
any
data
sanitization
.
In
extreme
cases
,
the
attacker
can
change
variables
controlling
the
business
logic
of
the
application
.
For
instance
,
in
languages
like
PHP
,
a
number
of
poorly
set
default
configurations
may
allow
the
user
to
override
variables
.
