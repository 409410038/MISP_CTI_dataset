The
TV
channel
``
CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn
''
on
17.01.2023
about
12:39
published
information
on
the
violation
of
the
staffing
of
several
elements
of
the
information
and
communication
system
(
hereinafter
-
ICS
)
Ukrainian
National
News
Agency
``
Ukrinform
''
.
At
the
request
of
the
Agency
,
the
Government
Emergency
Response
Team
of
Ukraine
CERT-UA
on
January
17
,
2023
initiated
measures
to
study
cyberattacks
.
As
of
January
27
,
2023
,
5
samples
of
malware
(
scripts
)
were
detected
,
the
functionality
of
which
is
aimed
at
violating
the
integrity
and
availability
of
information
(
recording
of
files/
disks
with
zero
bytes/satisfactory
data
and
their
subsequent
deletion
)
,
namely
:
CaddyWiper
(
Windows
)
ZeroWipe
(
Windows
)
Skeleton
(
Windows
)
AwfulShred
(
Linux
)
BidSwipe
(
FreeBSD
)
It
is
found
that
the
attackers
made
a
failed
attempt
to
disrupt
the
staffing
of
users
'
computers
using
malicious
programs-destructors
CaddyWiper
and
ZeroWipe
,
as
well
as
the
legitimate
utility
Sselete
(
which
was
supposed
to
be
started
using
``
news.bat
''
)
.
At
the
same
time
,
in
order
to
centrally
spread
malware
,
a
group
policy
object
(
GPO
)
was
created
,
which
in
turn
ensured
the
creation
of
appropriate
planned
tasks
.
There
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
stage
of
intelligence
of
the
ICS
of
the
Ukrainian
National
News
Agency
``
Ukrinform
''
is
conducted
no
later
than
07.12.2022
.
It
is
established
that
the
final
stage
of
the
cyber
attack
was
initiated
on
January
17
,
2023
,
however
,
it
was
only
partially
successful
,
in
particular
,
in
relation
to
several
storage
systems
.
The
research
process
identifies
the
element
of
the
ICS
,
which
creates
the
preconditions
for
unauthorized
remote
access
to
the
Agency
's
information
resources
.
Taking
into
account
the
results
of
the
study
,
we
consider
it
possible
to
claim
that
the
cyber
attack
was
carried
out
by
the
group
UAC-0082
(
Sandworm
)
,
whose
activity
is
associated
with
gu
gsh
zs
rf
.
It
should
be
noted
that
the
mentioned
telegram
channel
,
along
with
the
typical
messages
about
DDoS
attacks
and
defes
,
exclusively
covers
the
destructive
activity
carried
out
by
the
mentioned
group
.
