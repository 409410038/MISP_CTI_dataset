This
attack
targets
the
use
of
the
backslash
in
alternate
encoding
.
An
attacker
can
provide
a
backslash
as
a
leading
character
and
causes
a
parser
to
believe
that
the
next
character
is
special
.
This
is
called
an
escape
.
By
using
that
trick
,
the
attacker
tries
to
exploit
alternate
ways
to
encode
the
same
character
which
leads
to
filter
problems
and
opens
avenues
to
attack
.
