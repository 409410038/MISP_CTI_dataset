An
adversary
embeds
malicious
scripts
in
content
that
will
be
served
to
web
browsers
.
The
goal
of
the
attack
is
for
the
target
software
,
the
client-side
browser
,
to
execute
the
script
with
the
users
'
privilege
level
.
An
attack
of
this
type
exploits
a
programs
'
vulnerabilities
that
are
brought
on
by
allowing
remote
hosts
to
execute
code
and
scripts
.
Web
browsers
,
for
example
,
have
some
simple
security
controls
in
place
,
but
if
a
remote
attacker
is
allowed
to
execute
scripts
(
through
injecting
them
in
to
user-generated
content
like
bulletin
boards
)
then
these
controls
may
be
bypassed
.
Further
,
these
attacks
are
very
difficult
for
an
end
user
to
detect
.
