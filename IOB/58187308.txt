Microsoft
has
uncovered
stealthy
and
targeted
malicious
activity
focused
on
post-compromise
credential
access
and
network
system
discovery
aimed
at
critical
infrastructure
organizations
in
the
United
States
.
The
attack
is
carried
out
by
Volt
Typhoon
,
a
state-sponsored
actor
based
in
China
that
typically
focuses
on
espionage
and
information
gathering
.
Microsoft
assesses
with
moderate
confidence
that
this
Volt
Typhoon
campaign
is
pursuing
development
of
capabilities
that
could
disrupt
critical
communications
infrastructure
between
the
United
States
and
Asia
region
during
future
crises
.
Volt
Typhoon
has
been
active
since
mid-2021
and
has
targeted
critical
infrastructure
organizations
in
Guam
and
elsewhere
in
the
United
States
.
In
this
campaign
,
the
affected
organizations
span
the
communications
,
manufacturing
,
utility
,
transportation
,
construction
,
maritime
,
government
,
information
technology
,
and
education
sectors
.
Observed
behavior
suggests
that
the
threat
actor
intends
to
perform
espionage
and
maintain
access
without
being
detected
for
as
long
as
possible
.
