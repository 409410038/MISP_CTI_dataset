An
iterative
approach
to
input
validation
may
be
required
to
ensure
that
no
dangerous
characters
are
present
.
It
may
be
necessary
to
implement
redundant
checking
across
different
input
validation
layers
.
Ensure
that
invalid
data
is
rejected
as
soon
as
possible
and
do
not
continue
to
work
with
it
.
Make
sure
to
perform
input
validation
on
canonicalized
data
(
i.e
.
data
that
is
data
in
its
most
standard
form
)
.
This
will
help
avoid
tricky
encodings
getting
past
the
filters
.
Assume
all
input
is
malicious
.
Create
a
white
list
that
defines
all
valid
input
to
the
software
system
based
on
the
requirements
specifications
.
Input
that
does
not
match
against
the
white
list
should
not
be
permitted
to
enter
into
the
system
.
