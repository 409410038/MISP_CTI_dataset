The
CYFIRMA
research
team
has
identified
a
new
up-and-coming
European
threat
actor
group
known
as
FusionCore
.
Running
Malware-as-a-service
,
along
with
the
hacker-for-
hire
operation
,
they
have
a
wide
variety
of
tools
and
services
that
are
being
offered
on
their
website
,
making
it
a
one-stop-shop
for
threat
actors
looking
to
purchase
cost-
effective
yet
customizable
malware
.
The
operators
have
started
a
ransomware
affiliate
program
that
equips
the
attackers
with
the
ransomware
and
affiliate
software
to
manage
victims
.
FusionCore
typically
provides
sellers
with
a
detailed
set
of
instructions
for
any
service
or
product
being
sold
,
enabling
individuals
with
minimal
experience
to
carry
out
complex
attacks
.
The
members
of
the
new
FusionCore
group
are
coming
up
with
their
own
set
of
malwares
,
with
the
help
of
more
seasoned
malware
developers
present
in
the
group
.
Their
developing
catalogue
of
tools
suggests
they
have
the
ambition
to
create
a
suite
,
covering
most
,
if
not
all
of
kill-chain
,
creating
a
one-stop
shop
for
threat
actors
.
Due
to
the
emergence
of
Malware-as-a-Service
(
MaaS
)
,
cyber-attacks
have
become
more
sophisticated
than
before
.
With
the
potential
of
a
single
data
breach
bringing
down
an
entire
system
,
attackers
currently
have
a
significant
advantage
.
It
is
also
imperative
to
have
complete
visibility
onto
the
attack
surface
,
as
security
teams
can
not
protect
against
what
they
can
not
see
.
