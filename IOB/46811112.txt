Versionize
is
a
framework
for
version
tolerant
serializion/deserialization
of
Rust
data
structures
,
designed
for
usecases
that
need
fast
deserialization
times
and
minimal
size
overhead
.
An
issue
was
discovered
in
the
&
#
8216
;
Versionize
:
:deserialize
&
#
8217
;
implementation
provided
by
the
&
#
8216
;
versionize
&
#
8217
;
crate
for
&
#
8216
;
vmm_sys_utils
:
:fam
:
:FamStructWrapper
'
,
which
can
lead
to
out
of
bounds
memory
accesses
.
The
impact
started
with
version
0.1.1
.
The
issue
was
corrected
in
version
0.1.10
by
inserting
a
check
that
verifies
,
for
any
deserialized
header
,
the
lengths
of
compared
flexible
arrays
are
equal
and
aborting
deserialization
otherwise
.
