Make
sure
that
ANY
failure
occurring
in
the
filtering
or
input
validation
routine
is
properly
handled
and
that
offending
input
is
NOT
allowed
to
go
through
.
Basically
make
sure
that
the
vault
is
closed
when
failure
occurs
.
Pre-design
:
Use
a
language
or
compiler
that
performs
automatic
bounds
checking
.
Pre-design
through
Build
:
Compiler-based
canary
mechanisms
such
as
StackGuard
,
ProPolice
and
the
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
/GS
flag
.
Unless
this
provides
automatic
bounds
checking
,
it
is
not
a
complete
solution
.
Operational
:
Use
OS-level
preventative
functionality
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
Design
:
Use
an
abstraction
library
to
abstract
away
risky
APIs
.
Not
a
complete
solution
.
