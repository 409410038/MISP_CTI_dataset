Conclusion
In
the
fourth
quarter
of
2022
,
we
discovered
a
new
subgroup
of
APT41
that
we
tracked
as
Earth
Longzhi
.
In
the
process
,
we
revealed
two
different
campaigns
that
took
place
from
2020
to
2022
.
This
follow-up
article
to
our
previous
report
aims
to
flag
readers
that
Earth
Longzhi
remains
in
circulation
and
is
expected
to
improve
its
TTPs
.
Here
,
we
revealed
that
the
campaign
deployed
a
fake
mpclient.dll
,
launched
through
signed
Windows
Defender
binaries
,
to
decrease
its
risk
of
exposure
.
To
evade
and
disable
security
products
,
Earth
Longzhi
adopted
the
following
approaches
:
It
used
Microsoft
Windows
RPC
to
create
a
system
service
instead
of
standard
Windows
APIs
.
It
terminated
running
security
products
via
a
vulnerable
driver
,
zamguard64.sys
,
which
is
essentially
a
BYOVD
attack
.
It
modified
IFEO
registries
to
restrict
the
execution
of
security
products
.
We
also
shared
some
interesting
threat-hunting
findings
.
Although
the
samples
that
we
・
ve
collected
resemble
testing
files
,
they
can
still
be
useful
because
they
contain
information
on
Earth
Longzhi
・
s
potential
targets
and
new
techniques
that
it
might
employ
in
the
future
.
From
the
embedded
documents
that
we
・
ve
collected
,
we
can
infer
that
Vietnam
and
Indonesia
are
the
countries
that
they
will
likely
aim
at
next
.
Notably
,
the
group
・
s
possible
abuse
of
Task
Scheduler
to
escalate
privileges
for
persistence
is
a
new
technique
that
it
might
use
in
future
campaigns
.
Another
noteworthy
insight
is
that
the
threat
actors
showed
an
inclination
for
using
open-source
projects
to
implement
their
own
tools
.
There
is
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
group
spruces
up
its
toolset
during
periods
of
inactivity
.
With
this
knowledge
in
mind
,
organizations
should
stay
vigilant
against
the
continuous
development
of
new
stealthy
schemes
by
cybercriminals
.
