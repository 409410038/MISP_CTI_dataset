In
TightVNC
1.3.10
,
there
is
an
integer
signedness
error
and
resultant
heap-based
buffer
overflow
in
InitialiseRFBConnection
in
rfbproto.c
(
for
the
vncviewer
component
)
.
There
is
no
check
on
the
size
given
to
malloc
,
e.g.
,
-1
is
accepted
.
This
allocates
a
chunk
of
size
zero
,
which
will
give
a
heap
pointer
.
However
,
one
can
send
0xffffffff
bytes
of
data
,
which
can
have
a
DoS
impact
or
lead
to
remote
code
execution
.
