An
attacker
exploits
a
weakness
in
ATA
security
on
a
drive
to
gain
access
to
the
information
the
drive
contains
without
supplying
the
proper
credentials
.
ATA
Security
is
often
employed
to
protect
hard
disk
information
from
unauthorized
access
.
The
mechanism
requires
the
user
to
type
in
a
password
before
the
BIOS
is
allowed
access
to
drive
contents
.
Some
implementations
of
ATA
security
will
accept
the
ATA
command
to
update
the
password
without
the
user
having
authenticated
with
the
BIOS
.
This
occurs
because
the
security
mechanism
assumes
the
user
has
first
authenticated
via
the
BIOS
prior
to
sending
commands
to
the
drive
.
Various
methods
exist
for
exploiting
this
flaw
,
the
most
common
being
installing
the
ATA
protected
drive
into
a
system
lacking
ATA
security
features
(
a.k.a
.
hot
swapping
)
.
Once
the
drive
is
installed
into
the
new
system
the
BIOS
can
be
used
to
reset
the
drive
password
.
