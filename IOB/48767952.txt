AhnLab
Security
Emergency
response
Center
(
ASEC
)
has
recently
discovered
the
Trigona
ransomware
being
installed
on
poorly
managed
MS-SQL
servers
.
Trigona
is
a
relatively
recent
ransomware
that
was
first
discovered
in
October
2022
,
and
Unit
42
has
recently
published
a
report
based
on
the
similarity
between
Trigona
and
the
CryLock

.

Poorly
Managed
MS-SQL
Servers
Poorly
managed
MS-SQL
servers
typically
refer
to
those
that
are
exposed
to
external
connections
and
have
simple
account
credentials
,
rendering
them
vulnerable
to
brute
force
or
dictionary
attacks
.
If
a
threat
actor
manages
to
log
in
,
control
over
the
system
will
be
passed
to
them
,
allowing
them
to
install
malware
or
execute
malicious
commands
.
Additionally
,
MS-SQL
can
be
installed
on
both
Windows
servers
and
desktop
environments
.
For
example
,
there
are
cases
where
MS-SQL
is
installed
alongside
certain
ERP
and
work-purpose
solutions
during
their
installation
process
.
Because
of
this
,
Windows
servers
and
Windows
desktop
environments
can
both
be
targeted
for
MS-SQL
Server
attacks
.
ASEC
is
monitoring
attacks
against
poorly
managed
MS-SQL
servers
.
ASEC
Report
is
also
sharing
quarterly
statistics
of
information
including
the
number
of
attacks
and
malware
used
in
attacks
.

Most
malware
types
can
be
used
in
these
attacks
,
including
Trojans
,
backdoors
,
CoinMiners
,
and
ransomware
.
When
it
comes
to
ransomware
,
Mallox
and
GlobeImposter
are
the
most
used
.
