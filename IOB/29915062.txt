Security
by
Obscurity
is
not
a
solution
to
preventing
SQL
Injection
.
Rather
than
suppress
error
messages
and
exceptions
,
the
application
must
handle
them
gracefully
,
returning
either
a
custom
error
page
or
redirecting
the
user
to
a
default
page
,
without
revealing
any
information
about
the
database
or
the
application
internals
.
Strong
input
validation
-
All
user-controllable
input
must
be
validated
and
filtered
for
illegal
characters
as
well
as
SQL
content
.
Keywords
such
as
UNION
,
SELECT
or
INSERT
must
be
filtered
in
addition
to
characters
such
as
a
single-quote
(
'
)
or
SQL-comments
(
--
)
based
on
the
context
in
which
they
appear
.
