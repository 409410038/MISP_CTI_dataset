This
attack
is
a
specific
variation
on
leveraging
alternate
encodings
to
bypass
validation
logic
.
This
attack
leverages
the
possibility
to
encode
potentially
harmful
input
in
UTF-8
and
submit
it
to
applications
not
expecting
or
effective
at
validating
this
encoding
standard
making
input
filtering
difficult
.
UTF-8
(
8-bit
UCS/Unicode
Transformation
Format
)
is
a
variable-length
character
encoding
for
Unicode
.
Legal
UTF-8
characters
are
one
to
four
bytes
long
.
However
,
early
version
of
the
UTF-8
specification
got
some
entries
wrong
(
in
some
cases
it
permitted
overlong
characters
)
.
UTF-8
encoders
are
supposed
to
use
the
``
shortest
possible
''
encoding
,
but
naive
decoders
may
accept
encodings
that
are
longer
than
necessary
.
According
to
the
RFC
3629
,
a
particularly
subtle
form
of
this
attack
can
be
carried
out
against
a
parser
which
performs
security-critical
validity
checks
against
the
UTF-8
encoded
form
of
its
input
,
but
interprets
certain
illegal
octet
sequences
as
characters
.
