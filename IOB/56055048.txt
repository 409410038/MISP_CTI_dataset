encountered
a
previously
unnamed
ransomware
strain
,
we
dubbed
Rorschach
,
deployed
against
a
US-based
company
.
Rorschach
ransomware
appears
to
be
unique
,
sharing
no
overlaps
that
could
easily
attribute
it
to
any
known
ransomware
strain
.
In
addition
,
it
does
not
bear
any
kind
of
branding
which
is
a
common
practice
among
ransomware
groups
.
The
ransomware
is
partly
autonomous
,
carrying
out
tasks
that
are
usually
manually
performed
during
enterprise-wide
ransomware
deployment
,
such
as
creating
a
domain
group
policy
(
GPO
)
.
In
the
past
,
similar
functionality
was
linked
to
LockBit
2.0
.
The
ransomware
is
highly
customizable
and
contains
technically
unique
features
,
such
as
the
use
of
direct
syscalls
,
rarely
observed
in
ransomware
.
Moreover
,
due
to
different
implementation
methods
,
Rorschach
is
one
of
the
fastest
ransomware
observed
,
by
the
speed
of
encryption
.
The
ransomware
was
deployed
using
DLL
side-loading
of
a
Cortex
XDR
Dump
Service
Tool
,
a
signed
commercial
security
product
,
a
loading
method
which
is
not
commonly
used
to
load
ransomware
.
The
vulnerability
was
properly
reported
to
Palo
Alto
Networks
.
